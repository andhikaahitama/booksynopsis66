<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>The Way</h2><p>The 365 fresh and relevant daily devotions in The Way confirm why it was a million-copy best seller when published in 1946. E. Stanley Jones, one of the greatest Christian leaders and statesmen of his day, was truly a man ahead of his time. The way to live, according to Jones, is stamped within us. It is not merely written in books, it is written into our very make-up. It is not only written in texts of scriptures but in the texture of our beings. Each daily entry builds on the one before and describes the two roads we all can travel. The way God intended us to live does not deprive us of enjoyment&#x2014;it gives us the satisfaction of being all we were created to be. The Way is the one book E. Stanley Jones said he would choose to pass on to future generations. Updated for the twenty-first century by noted editor Dean Merrill, this dynamic daily</p><p>E. STANLEY JONES (1884-1973) was a man ahead of his time. In 1938, TIME magazine called him &#x201c;the world&#x2019;s greatest missionary.&#x201d; He is reported to have preached some 60,000 times, perhaps a world record. Listeners came to Christ on nearly every occasion. He advised U.S. presidents as well as Indian leaders and was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Jones wrote twentyeight books, including ten full-year devotionals, some of which became million-copy best sellers.</p><h2>The Way of the Sword (Young Samurai)</h2><p>After being shipwrecked in Japan, adopted, and taught the Way of the Warrior at samurai school, Jack is ready to embark on the next chapter of his training: the Way of the Sword.&nbsp; His lessons involve fighting blindfolded, using a b&#x2013;o staff, and finding messages in origami&#x2014;all while withstanding the constant pressure of being a foreigner. The stakes are raised even higher when the school holds a contest. The winners will learn the great samurai Masamoto-sama&#x2019;s secret martial arts technique. Jack is sure this is the key to protecting his prized possession&#x2014;his father&#x2019;s rutter&#x2014;from Dragon Eye, the ninja who will stop at nothing to get it.</p><p>Chris Bradford has trained in karate, kickboxing and samurai swordsmanship. He earned his black belt in Zen Kyo Shin Taijutsu, the secret fighting art of the ninja. Before writing the Young Samurai series, he was a professional musician and songwriter and has performed for HRH Queen Elizabeth II. You can learn more about Chris Bradford and his books at www.youngsamurai.com.Grade 6-9 Bradford raises the stakes for his blond samurai student in this second installment in the series. Previously shipwrecked after his father was murdered by the ninja leader Dragon Eye, Jack is continuing his training as a samurai at his foster father's school for young warriors. Dedicated to keeping his father's navigational log from Dragon Eye, who has tried to steal it before, Jack hides the book at the castle of the daimyo, where he feels it will be safer. In the meantime, he must train to participate in the Circle of Three, a trial that would allow him to learn a double-sword-fighting technique, one he feels he needs to defend himself against the ninja's treachery. To add to his worries, his friend Akiko is acting strangely, disappearing in the night, and Jack suspects she may be training as a ninja. Bradford combines the structure of a British school story with the flavor of 17th-century Japan, and his descriptions of both swordplay and hand-to-hand martial arts reveal his extensive knowledge of the subject. Young martial artists will be eager to try out sticky-hands drills in their own dojos. Though the secondary cast is often too large to keep track of and only a few of the characters are fully developed, the ongoing struggle between honorable samurai and dastardly ninja will draw both reluctant readers and enthusiasts of Japanese history. <i>Alana Joli Abbott, James Blackstone Memorial Library, Branford, CT</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Parenting as a Spiritual Journey explores the transformative spiritual adventure that all parents can experience while bringing up their children. <p><i>Parenting as a Spiritual Journey</i> shows, by looking at a typical day's routine, how even the seemingly insignificant moments in a day with your child can be full of spiritual meaning. From waking up in the morning to bedtime at night, there are so many opportunities for parent and child to connect in a spiritual way. Fuchs-Kreimer helps us see those possibilities, revealing how parents can come to recognize, understand and appreciate the joys, insecurities, wonder and awe that can contribute to the spiritual fulfillment of raising children. </p><p>Fuchs-Kreimer's interviews with over one hundred parents, plus her own experiences as a mother of two, illuminate the journey we take every day in raising our children. Included are rituals, prayers, and inspiring passages from sacred Jewish texts--as well as from other religious traditions--that are woven throughout this wise, funny and lyrical book.</p></p><p>Nancy Fuchs, Ph.D., is director of the religious studies program at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia.</p><h2>Modern Southwest Cuisine</h2><p>Offers nouvelle cuisine versions of traditional dishes of the American Southwest, including appetizers, soups, salads, seafood, poultry, meat, desserts, pickles and preserves</p><p>Part owner and chef at Saint Estephe, a gourmet restaurant in Manhattan Beach, Calif., Sedlar has developed "Modern Southwest Cuisine," combining the traditional ingredients of American Southwestern cooking with the techniques and sensibilities of nouvelle French cuisine in such inventive and tempting dishes as white chocolate corncobs with almond buttercream, caramel sauce and mango corn, and frog legs with gazpacho beurre blanc and mousselines of red and green pepper. Sedlar turns casual tacos into elegant hors d'oeuvres, filling miniature tortillas with French-style ingredients like truffled scrambled eggs or foie gras, or substituting salad leaves for the tortilla in radicchio tacos with smoked chicken, asparagus and red chili mayonnaise. He utilizes Southwestern Native American designs to decorate his multifaceted creations, which ravish the eye in such color photographs as Kachina mosaic of caviars with endive feathers and chocolate-truffle antelope torte with caramel-lime sauce. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Come Lord Jesus</h2><p>&#34;Come Lord Jesus&#34; is the heart cry of the church of God after she had been given the Revelation of Jesus Christ in the last book of the Bible. Christ is coming soon! The signs of the time point to His imminent return. Are you ready for Him, your Bridegroom? This commentary on the book of Revelation by Watchman Nee is timely in helping us understand the future. It not only gives us a sequence of coming events, but more so brings us into the spirit of prophecy which is the testimony of Jesus (Rev.19.10). It reveals to us the glory of Jesus Christ. This inspires us to know Him more and to be prepared to meet Him. All who wait for His return should read this most valuable volume.</p><p></p><h2>Workbook for Corey/Corey/Haynes&#39; Ethics in Action, 3rd</h2><p>The workbook includes exercises that correlate directly with each segment of the video, as well as self-assessments and self-inventories; skills checklists; the Coreys&#39; commentary; questions for application, discussion, and reflection; references to the main text; and more.</p><p></p><h2>A world to the west: A voyage around the world</h2><p>Like other young dreamers, Katie and Maurice Cloughley bought a sailboat and set off around the world. They met while taking sailing lessons in the west of England and after getting married, they worked for six years in northern Canada, earning the money for their ideal boat. When they found her, a lovely little Australian-built ketch, they renamed her Nanook of the North, planned for a five year voyage, and sailed away. A World to the West is the story of that first circum-navigation, with all its excitment and terror, adventure and fun, told by a paticulary gifted writer. This first round-the world trip laid the foundation for Katie and Maurice&#39;s life of astonishing contrasts. They alternated their years of sailing tropical oceans with years of working in isolated communities in the Artic, and their northern tales are told in Maurice&#39;s beautifully illustrated book, The Spell of the Midnight Sun. The Cloughleys now live perminently aboard Nanook. Maurice is working on his art-mainly wood-block prints and pen-and-ink drawings, like those that have been used in his books-and writing about their two-year sailing voyage down the Pacific coast of North America, from the Aleutian Isalnds to the Tierra del Fuego.</p><p></p><h2>A Short History of the Early Church</h2><p>For readers who want a brief yet reliable introduction to the history of the early church as well as for those who are looking for a quick review of the period, this volume furnishes a concise overview of the key events, figures, controversies, and councils essential for a proper understanding of the first seven centuries of the Christian church.<br><br>Harry R.

The river begins as a clear stream formed high in the mountains from melted snow. It slips over pebbles, skids round rocks and is fed by other streams, smaller and faster. Gradually, the river grows wider as it flows quietly past meadows, under bridges, through cities ... until, finally, after sliding slowly through mudflats and marshes, fresh water meets salt water to become part of the sea. Beautifully illustrated by Bee Willey, with a detailed spread at the end charting the key geographical stages of a river&#39;s journey.</p><p>Meredith Hooper has written over fifty books, on everything from pyramids to aeroplanes. This book is based partly on a river that flowed past her garden, and partly on rivers she has seen on her travels in many other parts of the world.Bee Wiley has created artwork for books, magazines, even CD covers. With this book, she says, the flow of the river (starting as a trickle, then gaining speed and collecting things on its way to the sea) is like the flow of teamwork that went into making River Story.A luscious blend of cool blues and verdant greens lights up the pages of this poetic picture book, which traces the course of a river from its source in the mountains to the sea. Hooper's (The Pebble in My Pocket) lyrical use of language emulates the rhythms of the river. Beginning with the languid, soothing sounds of alliteration ("a small shining stream slipping over pebbles"), the narrative picks up the pace as the river gains momentum at a waterfall ("snowfalls of water,/ springfuls of water,/ streamfuls of water"), then quiets down as it leaves the mountains ("It winds between meadows, long strands of waterweed streaking its surface") before its final arrival where "waves wash sand, and fresh water meets salt water." Willey (The Golden Hoard) adds a good measure of child appeal. For a spread that allows readers to peek beneath the water's surface, "little fish darting, bottles dropped, treasures lost," she shows a beloved toy airplane beached on the river bottom. Her palette and line seem especially suited for these riverside views, from the slender reeds of a cattail to a sandpiper's beak to the water itself, as it gushes and crashes, ripples and flows downriver.

The IV Layer Approach to Becoming the Strongest Version of Yourself</h2><p>GREAT BOOK FOR ATHLETES who want to exceed and get ahead of the game mentally, physically, and spiritually. Eliot goes deep.</p><p></p><h2>Arcadia</h2><p>Product Description From the bestselling author of The Monsters of Templeton comes a lyrical and gripping story of a great American dream. In the fields of western New York State in the 1970s, a few dozen idealists set out to live off the land, founding what would become a commune centered on the grounds of a decaying mansion called Arcadia House. Arcadia follows this romantic, rollicking, and tragic utopian dream from its hopeful start through its heyday and after. Arcadia&#39;s inhabitants include Handy, a musician and the group&#39;s charismatic leader; Astrid, a midwife; Abe, a master carpenter; Hannah, a baker and historian; and Abe and Hannah&#39;s only child, the book&#39;s protagonist, Bit, who is born soon after the commune is created. While Arcadia rises and falls, Bit, too, ages and changes. If he remains in love with the peaceful agrarian life in Arcadia and deeply attached to its residents - including Handy and Astrid&#39;s lithe and deeply troubled daughter, Helle - how can Bit become his own man? How will he make his way through life and the world outside of Arcadia where he must eventually live? With Arcadia, her first novel since her lauded debut, The Monsters of Templeton, Lauren Groff establishes herself not only as one of the most gifted young fiction writers at work today but also as one of our most accomplished literary artists. About the Author Lauren Groff was born in Cooperstown, New York. She has a BA from Amherst College and an MFA from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and has won fellowships to the Vermont Studio Center and Yaddo. Her debut novel, The Monsters of Templeton, was a New York Times bestseller and was shortlisted for the Orange Broadband Award for New Writers 2008.

It&#39;s not possible to write any better without showing off.&#34; -- Richard Russo &#34;Part Stone Diaries, part Lord of the Flies, part something out of a Shakespearean tragedy, Lauren Groff&#39;s Arcadia is so uniquely absorbing that you finish it as if waking from a dream. Groff is one of our most talented writers, and Arcadia one of the most revelatory, magical and ambitious novels I&#39;ve read in years.&#34; -- Kate Walbert, author of the New York Times Book Review&#39;s 10 best books of the year, the New York Times bestselling novel A Short History of Women &#34;&#39;Arcadia swings gently between moments of pure happiness and exquisitely described melancholy ... beautiful prose ... Arcadia the commune may have been an experiment in a new way of living but Arcadia the book explores several lifestyles, without the need for the reader to blister their hands weeding a soy patch. Arcadia is smart, beautiful, rooted in an earthy and glorious location. Read it and consider your place in the world and the people you love, but mostly read it for its beauty. Groff&#39;s beautifully written Arcadia paints a lyrical picture ... You fall in love with Arcadia&#39;s protagonist, Bit, and find yourself transported to a different time, place and lifestyle.&#39;&#34; Stylist 5 stars &#34;Lauren Groff&#39;s Arcadia is so immersed in the life of a hippie commune that patchouli ought to waft off its pages.Ms. Groff has taken a quaint, easily caricatured community and given it true universality, not just the knee-jerk kind that Arcadian platitudes espoused. Even more unexpectedly, she has expanded this period piece so that it stretches from 1965 to 2018, coaxing forth a remarkable amount of suspense from the way her characters change over time. And a book that might have been small, dated and insular winds up feeling timeless and vast. The raw beauty of Ms. Groff&#39;s prose is one of the best things about Arcadia. But it is by no means this book&#39;s only kind of splendour.Arcadia is stunningly sensual and visceral in describing behaviour straight out of a time capsule.A shimmering evocation of the commune&#39;s heyday. Even allowing for Ms. Groff&#39;s extraordinarily rich imagination, she writes about this life as if she has known it.&#34; New York Times &#34;With Arcadia, Groff has woven her own tale, in eloquent prose that&#39;s rich in sense of place and depth of feeling&#34; -- Holly Williams Independent on Sunday</p><h2>Preserving (Made At Home)</h2><p><p> <b><i>A new series for living the good life!</i> </b></p><p><b> Made At Home</b> </p><p> This exciting series comes from the father-and-son team Dick and James Strawbridge, who live "the good life" on their small acreage.

The program for the occasion featured music, prayer, orations, and benedictions. In the middle of it all, the president gave a few commemorative remarks, speaking for just two minutes, delivering what we now know as the Gettysburg Address. <br><br>Challenged to mark the enormity of the battle&#x2014;which had turned the tide of the war, though neither side realized it yet&#x2014;Lincoln used 272 words in ten sentences to rededicate the Union to the preservation of freedom. It remains the most important statement of our nation&#x2019;s commitment to personal liberty since the Revolutionary War and has become one of the most important speeches in American history, a cornerstone of who we are as a country. A century and a half later, we still hold Lincoln&#x2019;s message in our hearts. <br><br>For Gettysburg Replies, the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum challenged presidents, judges, historians, filmmakers, poets, actors, and others to craft 272 words of their own to celebrate Lincoln, the Gettysburg Address, or a related topic that stirs their passions. President Jimmy Carter reveals how the Gettysburg Address helped bring Egypt and Israel closer at the Camp David Peace Accords. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O&#x2019;Connor reflects on Lincoln&#x2019;s dedication to the importance of civic education. General Colin Powell explains how Martin Luther King Jr. took up Lincoln&#x2019;s mantle and carried it forward. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg touches on the benefits and perils of hero worship. Poet Laureate Billy Collins explores the dichotomy between the private man who wrote poetry (&#x201c;My Childhood Home I See Again&#x201d;) and the president who stood before all. Attorney Alan Dershowitz echoes Lincoln&#x2019;s words to rally us to the freedom from weapons of mass destruction. <br> <br>Gettysburg Replies features images of important Lincoln documents and artifacts, including the first copy of the address that Lincoln wrote out after delivering it, the program from the cemetery dedication, Lincoln&#x2019;s presidential seal, and more. Together, these words and images create a lasting tribute not only to Lincoln himself but also the power of his devotion to freedom.</p><p>The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum in Springfield, Illinois, has presented the Lincoln legacy to more than 3 million visitors since April 2005.

W. Bush and the Points of Light Foundation.&#x201c;The Gettysburg Address is the most famous and almost certainly the greatest speech ever made by an American president. These reflections can only go to deepen our appreciation for the elegance of the words and unique leadership they reflect.&#x201d; --Scott Turow<br><br>&#x201c;In 272 words, Lincoln&#x2019;s Gettysburg Address extolled the soldiers who had given the last full measure of devotion that the nation might live and experience a new birth of freedom.

He lives in New York City.Kindergarten-Grade 2-With simple acrylics accented with cake-decorating squiggles, Rylant illustrates her saccharine story of an orphan cat fawned over by the bakers and visitors to a cookie store. The bakery is part of a strip of specialty shops that include Martha Jane's Bookshop and its canine matchmaker introduced in Rylant's The Bookshop Dog (Scholastic, 1996). Unlike her doggy drama, though, there isn't any tension here, just a low-key description of the cat's largely indolent lifestyle. Readers learn that one of the bakers in this doll-like town found the scrawny kitty while opening the shop several years earlier, nursed him to health on cream and cookie dough, and, with the consent of the other employees, designated him the store mascot. The children adore him and let him lick drops of milk from their fingers while they eat their snacks. Recipes for seven treats follow the story (no mention of adult supervision being necessary). Bold colors and find-the-kitty double-page spreads will appeal to preschoolers (who won't know what ginger creams and bachelor buttons are, just that they probably taste good) and the Pleasantville perfection will give them sweet, reassuring dreams.

Drawing on accounts in the <i>Slave Narrative Collection</i>, compiled during the 1930s as part of the Federal Writers' Project, Raven presents her story from the viewpoint of Christmas John, 12, born on Christmas morning and raised on a Kentucky plantation by Granny Judith, who was captured as a child in Africa. One night Granny Judith asks him to row a young slave across the river to freedom in Ohio. Christmas John is scared, but he helps the slave and many others escape. Finally, it becomes too dangerous for him to stay on the plantation. Granny Judith wants him to leave, but how can he leave her behind? The older mentor is as tough as the young boy, and Lewis' beautiful, unframed double-page spreads depict the bond between them, including their heartbreaking farewell embrace. The close-ups filled with the richly colored details of Granny Judith's dyed quilts are in stark contrast to the pictures of the night sky and black water, and the shadows of the runaways in the woods. Words and pictures work perfectly together, making sound from silence and light from darkness. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Using instinct to guide her, she copied everything they did and soon learned to fend for herself. </p><p>At around 10 years old, a completely feral Marina was returned to civilisation by hunters, who sold her as a slave to a brothel. Beaten daily and groomed to be a prostitute, she escaped - to live the perilous existence of a Colombian city street kid. Marina's life as a wild child wasn't over. In some ways, it had only just begun. </p><p>This is her astonishing story.</p></p><p><p>MARINA CHAPMAN is now married to an Englishman and living in Bradford, England. She plans to donate her share of the profits from this book to help finance charities that combat human trafficking and child slavery in Colombia.</p>&#x201c;Chapman tells the harrowing story of her being stolen from her home in Columbia in 1954 at the young age of four by unknown assailants and dropped in the woods to fend for herself. She found comfort and family among a group of monkeys, whose land she happened to stumble upon. The jungle, being an unforgiving place, forced Chapman to learn the ropes quickly, and she found solace in belonging to a group, regardless of species. In fact, as time progressed, she became more comfortable as a monkey than as a human, even being shunned by the indigenous people in the South American jungle. Throughout her time spent in the forest, Chapman learned an important lesson about belonging; &#x201c;Family is not just about who you appear to belong to... or who you look like... [it] is found anywhere you are loved and cared for.&#x201d; Unfortunately, this lesson was demonstrated again and again, as one day the little girl was taken from the jungle and began a more difficult life trying to survive the dangers of a &#x201c;people&#x2019;s world.&#x201d; Sold to a brothel, only to run away and become a street-hustler, then later staying with an abusive Mafioso family, life was not easy for the girl of many names, until finally one woman took pity on her and offered her to a better life. <strong>This book, which is as much a memoir about the importance of classification and belonging as it is about the endurance of the human spirit, will be enjoyed by those looking for a story of perseverance through even the greatest obstacles life brings.</strong>&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p><h2>The Confessions of Saint Augustine</h2><p>The Confessions of St. Augustine has a special place among the world&#39;s greatest books.

Despite his mother's pious influence, Augustine embarked on several years of wild living when he began his education at the University of Carthage. During this time he fathered a child and adopted the Manichean faith, a sect whose followers professed to have received from their founder a higher truth than from Christ. After years of seeking and eventual disillusionment with the Manichean ways, Augustine acknowledged Jesus as Lord during a dramatic garden conversion.

He has been a newspaperman in New York City for nearly forty years.Obituaries tell us not only about who died, but who lived -- and how. In reading them we discover that some of the lives that have had the most impact on our own were lived by men and women we have never heard of. Other lives have had an impact that is small or even nil, but seem to suggest something large or telling about what it is to be human in a particular place and time. <p>Few people had a greater impact on the way we live now than J. Presper Eckert, Jr., and John W. Mauchly, who are regarded as the principal developers of the computer. Their pioneering work changed the world forever, but when they died they were hardly household names, even in the households in which their invention has become a common appliance.</p><p>Maggie Kuhn, who had worked twenty-five years for the United Presbyterian Church in New York, commuting daily from her home in Philadelphia, reached the mandatory retirement age of sixty-five and was forced to leave her job in 1970. "They gave me a sewing machine," she recalled, "but I never opened it. I was too busy." Within months of her retirement, she was organizing the Gray Panther movement to campaign against age discrimination. </p><p>Anne Scheiber had no close family and no friends. She had no projects, no charities, did no volunteer work. She lived simply and cared nothing about possessions. After she retired a half century ago from the Internal Revenue Service, she devoted herself to the stock market, turning her $5,000 savings into a $22 million portfolio. She lived reclusively until she was 101, and when she died, she left her entire fortune to Yeshiva University -- an institution with which she had no direct contact -- to set up scholarships for needy women students. </p><p>J. Prosper Eckert, Jr., and John W. Mauchly, Maggie Kuhn and Anne Scheiber, are among the hundred or so men and women you will meet in the pages of this celebratory book. They had little in common except that they were Americans and that when they died their lives were illuminated in obituaries and farewells in <i>The New York Times.</i> These brief and elegantly written accounts of their time on earth -- however glorious or humble, happy or sad, long or short -- evoke laughter or tears or wonder at the astonishing variety of human experience. At least that is what I thought when I chose them from among the thousands of obituaries and farewells that have appeared in The Times since the early 1980s.</p><p></p><p>The selection process was quite personal. I responded largely to storytelling that was lively, that stimulated or moved me or made me smile. I particularly enjoyed reading about the remarkable life of someone I had never encountered before and feeling that with his or her passing, the world had become a duller place. I also rooted for people who sustained hardships and came out all right in the end. I'm sure my reactions matched those of legions of Times readers who have discovered that the obit pages are the best read in the newspaper, invariably satisfying and even joyful on occasion. These readers understand that there's nothing morbid about a good obituary because a good obit is about life and not death. </p><p></p></p><h2>Shadows of Death: Terrifying Tales by H. P.

P. Lovecraft<b> </b>(1890&#x2014;1937)<b> </b>lived his life in the moody New England that was the setting for his tales. His writing appeared in some of his era&#x2019;s most famous pulp magazines, but as no book of his work was published in his lifetime, Lovecraft died in relative poverty and obscurity. Since his death he has been recognized as one of the most influential cult horror writers of the twentieth century. His influence on American horror can be detected in the work of Stephen King, Anne Rice, Clive Barker, and many others.The Shadow Out of Time<br><br> After twenty-two years of nightmare and terror, saved only by a desperate conviction of the mythical source of certain impressions, I am unwilling to vouch for the truth of that which I think I found in Western Australia on the night of July 17&#x2013;18, 1935. There is reason to hope that my experience was wholly or partly an hallucination&#x2014;for which, indeed, abundant causes existed. And yet, its realism was so hideous that I sometimes find hope impossible.<br><br> If the thing did happen, then man must be prepared to accept notions of the cosmos, and of his own place in the seething vortex of time, whose merest mention is paralyzing. He must, too, be placed on guard against a specific, lurking peril which, though it will never engulf the whole race, may impose monstrous and unguessable horrors upon certain venturesome members of it.<br><br> It is for this latter reason that I urge, with all the force of my being, a final abandonment of all the attempts at unearthing those fragments of unknown, primordial masonry which my expedition set out to investigate.<br><br> Assuming that I was sane and awake, my experience on that night was such as has befallen no man before. It was, moreover, a frightful confirmation of all I had sought to dismiss as myth and dream. Mercifully there is no proof, for in my fright I lost the awesome object which would&#x2014;if real and brought out of that noxious abyss&#x2014;have formed irrefutable evidence.<br><br> When I came upon the horror I was alone&#x2014;and I have up to now told no one about it. I could not stop the others from digging in its direction, but chance and the shifting sand have so far saved them from finding it. Now I must formulate some definite statement&#x2014;not only for the sake of my own mental balance, but to warn such others as may read it seriously.<br><br> These pages&#x2014;much in whose earlier parts will be familiar to close readers of the general and scientific press&#x2014;are written in the cabin of the ship that is bringing me home. I shall give them to my son, Professor Wingate Peaslee of Miskatonic University&#x2014;the only member of my family who stuck to me after my queer amnesia of long ago, and the man best informed on the inner facts of my case. Of all living persons, he is least likely to ridicule what I shall tell of that fateful night.<br><br> I did not enlighten him orally before sailing, because I think he had better have the revelation in written form. Reading and rereading at leisure will leave with him a more convincing picture than my confused tongue could hope to convey.<br><br> He can do anything that he thinks best with this account&#x2014;showing it, with suitable comment, in any quarters where it will be likely to accomplish good. It is for the sake of such readers as are unfamiliar with the earlier phases of my case that I am prefacing the revelation itself with a fairly ample summary of its background.<br><br> My name is Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee, and those who recall the newspaper tales of a generation back&#x2014;or the letters and articles in psychological journals six or seven years ago&#x2014;will know who and what I am. The press was filled with the details of my strange amnesia in 1908&#x2013;13, and much was made of the traditions of horror, madness, and witchcraft which lurked behind the ancient Massachusetts town then and now forming my place of residence. Yet I would have it known that there is nothing whatever of the mad or sinister in my heredity and early life. This is a highly important fact in view of the shadow which fell so suddenly upon me from outside sources.<br><br> It may be that centuries of dark brooding had given to crumbling, whisper-haunted Arkham a peculiar vulnerability as regards such shadows&#x2014;though even this seems doubtful in the light of those other cases which I later came to study. But the chief point is that my own ancestry and background are altogether normal. What came, came from somewhere else&#x2014;where, I even now hesitate to assert in plain words.<br><br> I am the son of Jonathan and Hannah (Wingate) Peaslee, both of wholesome old Haverhill stock. I was born and reared in Haverhill&#x2014;at the old homestead in Boardman Street near Golden Hill&#x2014;and did not go to Arkham till I entered Miskatonic University as instructor of political economy in 1895.<br><br> For thirteen years more my life ran smoothly and happily. I married Alice Keezar of Haverhill in 1896, and my three children, Robert, Wingate, and Hannah, were born in 1898, 1900, and 1903, respectively. In 1898 I became an associate professor, and in 1902 a full professor. At no time had I the least interest in either occultism or abnormal psychology.<br><br> It was on Thursday, May 14, 1908, that the queer amnesia came. The thing was quite sudden, though later I realized that certain brief, glimmering visions of several hours previous&#x2014;chaotic visions which disturbed me greatly because they were so unprecedented&#x2014;must have formed premonitory symptoms. My head was aching, and I had a singular feeling&#x2014; altogether new to me&#x2014;that some one else was trying to get possession of my thoughts.<br><br> The collapse occurred about 10:20 a.m., while I was conducting a class in Political Economy VI&#x2014;history and present tendencies of economics&#x2014;for juniors and a few sophomores. I began to see strange shapes before my eyes, and to feel that I was in a grotesque room other than the classroom. My thoughts and speech wandered from my subject, and the students saw that something was gravely amiss. Then I slumped down, unconscious, in my chair, in a stupor from which no one could arouse me. Nor did my rightful faculties again look out upon the daylight of our normal world for five years, four months, and thirteen days. It is, of course, from others that I have learned what followed. I showed no sign of consciousness for sixteen and a half hours, though removed to my home at 27 Crane Street, and given the best of medical attention.<br><br> At 3 a.m. May 15th my eyes opened and I began to speak, but before long the doctor and my family were thoroughly frightened by the trend of my expression and language. It was clear that I had no rememberance of my identity and my past, though for some reason I seemed anxious to conceal this lack of knowledge. My eyes gazed strangely at the persons around me, and the flections of my facial muscles were altogether unfamiliar.<br><br> Even my speech seemed awkward and foreign. I used my vocal organs clumsily and gropingly, and my diction had a curiously stilted quality, as if I had laboriously learned the English language from books. The pronunciation was barbarously alien, whilst the idiom seemed to include both scraps of curious archaism and expressions of a wholly incomprehensible cast.<br><br> Of the latter, one in particular was very potently&#x2014;even terrifiedly&#x2014;recalled by the youngest of the physicians twenty years afterward. For at that late period such a phrase began to have an actual currency&#x2014;first in England and then in the United States&#x2014;and though of much complexity and indisputable newness, it reproduced in every least particular the mystifying words of the strange Arkham patient of 1908.<br><br> Physical strength returned at once, although I required an odd amount of reeducation in the use of my hands, legs, and bodily apparatus in general. Because of this and other handicaps inherent in the mnemonic lapse, I was for some time kept under strict medical care.<br><br> When I saw that my attempts to conceal the lapse had failed, I admitted it openly, and became eager for information of all sorts. Indeed, it seemed to the doctors that I lost interest in my proper personality as soon as I found the case of amnesia accepted as a natural thing.<br><br> They noticed that my chief efforts were to master certain points in history, science, art, language, and folklore&#x2014;some of them tremendously abstruse, and some childishly simple&#x2014;which remained, very oddly in many cases, outside my consciousness.<br><br> At the same time they noticed that I had an inexplicable command of many almost unknown sorts of knowledge&#x2014;a command which I seemed to wish to hide rather than display. I would inadvertently refer, with casual assurance, to specific events in dim ages outside of the range of accepted history&#x2014;passing off such references as a jest when I saw the surprise they created. And I had a way of speaking of the future which two or three times caused actual fright.<br><br> These uncanny flashes soon ceased to appear, though some observers laid their vanishment more to a certain furtive caution on my part than to any waning of the strange knowledge behind them. Indeed, I seemed anomalously avid to absorb the speech, customs, and perspectives of the age around me; as if I were a studious traveler from a far, foreign land.<br><br> As soon as permitted, I haunted the college library at all hours; and shortly began to arrange for those odd travels, and special courses at American and European Universities, which evoked so much comment during the next few years.<br><br> I did not at any time suffer from a lack of learned contacts, for my case had a mild celebrity among the psychologists of the period. I was lectured upon as a typical example of secondary personality&#x2014;even though I seemed to puzzle the lecturers now and then with some bizarre symptoms or some queer trace of carefully veiled mockery.<br><br> Of real friendliness, however, I encountered little. Something in my aspect and speech seemed to excite vague fears and aversions in every one I met, as if I were a being infinitely removed from all that is normal and healthful. This idea of a black, hidden horror connected with incalculable gulfs of some sort of distance was oddly widespread and persistent.<br><br> My own family formed no exception. From the moment of my strange waking my wife had regarded me with extreme horror and loathing, vowing that I was some utter alien usurping the body of her husband. In 1910 she obtained a legal divorce, nor would she ever consent to see me even after my return to normality in 1913. These feelings were shared by my elder son and my small daughter, neither of whom I have ever seen since.<br><br> Only my second son, Wingate, seemed able to conquer the terror and repulsion which my change aroused. He indeed felt that I was a stranger, but though only eight years old held fast to a faith that my proper self would return. When it did return he sought me out, and the courts gave me his custody. In succeeding years he helped me with the studies to which I was driven, and today, at thirty-five, he is a professor of psychology at Miskatonic.<br><br> But I do not wonder at the horror I caused&#x2014;for certainly, the mind, voice, and facial expression of the being that awakened on May 15, 1908, were not those of Nathaniel Wingate Peaslee.<br><br> I will not attempt to tell much of my life from 1908 to 1913, since readers may glean all the outward essentials&#x2014;as I largely had to do&#x2014;from files of old newspapers and scientific journals.<br><br> I was given charge of my funds, and spent them slowly and on the whole wisely, in travel and in study at various centers of learning. My travels, however, were singular in extreme, involving long visits to remote and desolate places.<br><br> In 1909 I spent a month in the Himalayas, and in 1911 aroused much attention through a camel trip into the unknown deserts of Arabia. What happened on those journeys I have never been able to learn.<br><br> During the summer of 1912 I chartered a ship and sailed in the Arctic, north of Spitzbergen, afterward showing signs of disappointment.<br><br> Later in that year I spent weeks alone beyond the limits of previous or subsequent exploration in the vast limestone cavern systems of western Virginia&#x2014;black labyrinths so complex that no retracing of my steps could even be considered.</p><h2>How to Do Automatic Writing (Llewellyn&#39;s &#34;How-To&#34; Vanguard)</h2><p>Your room is darkened, lit only by evocative, flickering candles.

Subdued tones and shadows reveal a geometry hidden beneath the visual distractions of daylight. Saville has sought out places that seem questionable&#x2014;deserted factories, back alleys, the shadowy infrastructure of urban highways and bridges that suggest the city&#x2019;s exoskeleton. <br><br>Unpopulated and sometimes unsettling, these images can be read on many levels; their evocative colors can seem garish or sublime. Taken together the photographs of <i>Night/Shift</i> create a unique portrait of the city and a personal meditation for each viewer.</p><p><b>Lynn Saville</b> is a photographer based in New York. Her work is widely collected by private collectors and institutions including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Museum of the City of New York, and the New York Public Library.<br><br><b>Arthur C. Danto</b> is the Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Columbia University and art critic for <i>The Nation</i>. He is the author of more than fifteen books, most recently <i>Unnatural Wonders: Essays from the Gap Between Art and Life</i>, and a contributor to several Monacelli titles including <i>Betty Woodman</i> (2006) and <i>Eric Fischl: 1970&#x2013;2007</i> (2008).<b>From Arthur C. Danto's introduction, "The city at night"</b><br><br>For some years, Lynn Saville was a night photographer. Her images expressed the way that darkness transforms objects, rendering them almost abstract through submerging surface detail in favor of velvety black shapes, often set against the somewhat more luminous night sky. They were in effect nocturnes&#x2014;night thoughts that turn what Hegel speaks of as &#x201c;the prose of the world&#x201d; into visual poetry. One had the thought that she must prefer the silent mysteries of the night world to the raucous, unforgiving light of day and took the risks of solitary explorations in darkness for the sake of its aesthetic rewards. The New York night world, as one knows from the photographs of Weegee, is full of violent incident. But Lynn&#x2019;s night world was of another order&#x2014;and looked, from her photographs of it, like something softened by subtracting the light from things, like a magical translation, to use Shakespeare&#x2019;s language, into something rich and strange. Her book Acquainted with the Night was like a travel book, bringing to stay-at-homes images of a far country that she had made her own.<br><br><i>Night/Shift</i>, as the unusual punctuation implies, marks an abrupt discontinuity in her work, in which the things are shown not in the harsh light of day, but without the benefit, one might say, of the natural cosmetic of darkness. This book addresses various sites in Greater New York, taken at the twilight hour through various seasons of the year. The sun has set, but its traces inflect the color of the sky, pinkish at the horizon, turning a luminous blue as one raises one&#x2019;s eyes, that subtly changes into a handsome translucent dark purple above that. The streetlights are on, patches of yellowish light fall across broken sidewalks, mostly empty, although the sites that attract this artist cannot at any time of day hold throngs. This is not the swanky New York of great stores and legendary restaurants. Rather, there is a feeling of run-downness, even of abandonment. It is mostly the New York of film noir, of old-fashioned iron viaducts, fire escapes, garbage cans, tenement buildings, uninviting facades, graffiti, curtainless windows, heavy shadows, neighborhood barrooms with crooked neon signs that in these contexts suggest that strangers might better go elsewhere. Every American city with an industrial past has sites like these&#x2014;bare ruined choirs where late the machinery rattled and hummed and workers with lunchboxes punched time clocks. What makes these distinctive of New York are the skylines and the great bridges that express the spirit the sites themselves expressed before they acquired the patina of abandonment and ruin. The city went on to find another identity for itself, and it even colonized its industrial endowment, turning leftover lofts into studios and ultimately into residential spaces, luxurious for their roominess and light. But the sites of interest to Lynn Saville are still unredeemed and rarely visited except by flaneurs like her, on aesthetic expeditions into the worn, the rejected, the forgotten, lonely, and dangerous remnants that no one but an artist with her sensibility knows what to do with, short of demolition. She captures them for the ashcan poetry of their desolation, against the day when someone puts them to more practical and certainly more profitable uses. <br><br>In many cases, of course, they are examples of the past-in-the-present, like the bridges and viaducts that are robust survivors, arteries for moving the city&#x2019;s relentless traffic. There are wonderful photographs of them, but as sites, not sights. No one visits the 125th Street viaduct the way, in Paris, they visit the Eiffel Tower, which belonged to the future when it was erected, but quickly enough lapsed into the period of wrought-iron architecture, lacy but beached by change. No one today would erect a bridge like the Brooklyn Bridge, which still has the dignity of constant use, but the architectural power of ancient arches. But for Saville it is a site, or background to a site, even though it is also one of the great sights of the city for a different kind of project than hers.<br><br>Most of these are not sites many of us would have occasion to visit, not at this particular hour, when there is an air of menace. Lynn Saville must have a taste for urban danger, or she would not be there when those who may have a reason to be there in daylight hours have left for home. Behind the camera is a vulnerable body animated by an intrepid spirit, adjusting lenses, composing, capturing a squalid scene of weeds and rust where a cross street ends at one of the city&#x2019;s rivers. Overhead one of the city&#x2019;s great bridges&#x2014;the Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, the Williamsburg Bridge, the Queensborough Bridge&#x2014;arches across our vision, casting light on the oily surface of passing water. There is scarcely a single place that evokes a desire to be there oneself, unless one shares the aesthetic of decay that drew the artist there. So she takes the risk a hunter takes, perhaps treating danger as a spice, but gaining the pleasure of having the site to herself. Just the thought of having to walk down a deserted street to reach the site makes one grateful to be home safe, turning the pages as her vision of this aging world unfolds. The city she is in search of is, after all, a kind of urban desert.</p><h2>Celebrate Piano!

Such Christianity and theology, of course, had its roots in Jewish monotheism, which later in the New Testament centered on a very high christology that assigned unique divine qualities to Jesus that were inherently reserved for the God of Israel as expounded in the God in Christ or Jesus is God New Testament narratives. The British then are counted in the body of believers of adhering to a theology of the oneness view of God from the ancient days of Christianity. This is coupled with the notation of ascribing to baptism in the name of Jesus only in the earlier centuries of Great Britain as explained by British theologians and scholars, one in particular, an Oxford University scholar has attested to such an early practice by the British. More pointedly, commissioned British studies have also concluded that the doctrine of the trinity is a dead letter in the British churches and one that is the subject of neglect, to the extent that trinitarian Christians are hard pressed to given an account, let alone a defense, of the doctrine of the trinity. While the author&#39;s work is not final on the subject of British apostolic oneness pentecostal theology yet it paves the way for a review of the studies that will lead to a wholesome perception that the apostolic oneness view of theology, whether it is in a form of sabellianism or modalism has been present within Britain for centuries. The God in Christ or Jesus is God christology is certainly something that British theologians have believed wholeheartedly as one notable British scholar has pointed out</p><p>The author was born in Birmingham, England, United Kingdom and is of an Indian Punjabi descent, growing up in a Sikh family. His primary field of biblical interest, historical research and study looks at the subject of baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38) in contrast to the later developed practice of Father, Son and Holy Ghost (Matthew 28:19) in addition to subjects relating to the doctrine of the apostles with respect to New Testament christology.

For generations the religious beliefs and practices of Native Americans have been the subject of public fascination and scholarly inquiry. Unfortunately, this ongoing interest has all too frequently been fueled by facile generalizations, inaccurate information, or inappropriate methods of investigation. Given the legacy of misrepresentation and mistrust, is it possible to fully appreciate the religious meanings and experiences of Native Americans? <p>This volume offers a stimulating, multidisciplinary set of essays by noted Native and non-Native scholars that explore the problems and prospects of understanding and writing about Native American spirituality in the twenty-first century. Considerable attention is given to the appropriateness and value of different interpretive paradigms for Native religion, including both "traditional" religion and Native Christianity. The book also investigates the ethics of religious representation, issues of authenticity, the commodification of spirituality, and pedagogical practices. Of special interest is the role of dialogue in expressing and understanding Native American religious beliefs and practices. A final set of essays explores the power of and reactions to Native spirituality from a long-term, historical perspective. </p></p><p>Lee Irwin is an associate professor of philosophy and religious studies at the College of Charleston in Charleston, South Carolina.

It's been barely a week since she succumbed to a spectacularly public nervous breakdown in front of hundreds of the nation's most important advertising and PR people. Jeanne certainly had her reasons--her mother's recent death, the discovery that her boyfriend had been sleeping with a dozen other women, and the assault charges that resulted when Jeanne retaliated in a creative way against him, involving condoms and peanut oil. <br><br> Now, en route to her brother's house in Portland, Jeanne impulsively decides to spend some time in picturesque Weltana.

Like Jeanne, all of them are trying to become better, braver versions of themselves.

She exacts a creative revenge involving condoms and peanut oil (her boyfriend is allergic), resulting in Slick Dick suing her. His betrayal, following the death of her mother and weeks of working excessive hours, results in an embarrassing public nervous breakdown. Jeanne sells everything and lands in a small Oregon town, where, amid an eccentric cast, she enrolls in a court-ordered anger-management class and attempts to rebuild her life. Her initial recovery breakthrough occurs when she falls while running naked (this, strangely, is part of the program) along the river and a nice man helps her. When her brother urges Jeanne to work on a political campaign for Oregon's governor, Jeanne discovers the candidate is her river rescuer. Other irons in the fire include Jeanne's efforts to renovate a derelict house and her ex's looming lawsuit. Though initially charming, the book has a tendency to overload the narrative with sass and excessive wordplay, which slows the plot and keeps the reader at an uncomfortable distance. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

An artful blend of colorful characters, seething resentment, calculated revenge, and a shocking, tragic cliffhanger distinguishes Archer&#39;s third volume of The Clifton Chronicles. Picking up where The Sins of the Father left off, readers discover whether Giles Barrington or Harry Clifton will inherit the late Hugo Barrington&#39;s fortune. Harry becomes a successful novelist and marries his true love Emma Barrington; they adopt a daughter with a secret past to join their son Sebastian. Poor smitten, likeable Giles, fighting for his political life as a member of Parliament, is lovesick for the scheming, vindictive Lady Virginia, whom he marries. Sensing disaster, on her death bed Lady Elizabeth Barrington writes Lady Virginia out of the will, prompting the unpopular Lady Virginia to enlist Giles&#39; nemesis, Major Alex Fisher, as she plots her way to the Barrington fortune. Sebastian becomes a young man, sowing his wild oats and naively getting mixed up with a school chum&#39;s nefarious father and his sketchy business. Business-savvy Emma earns a college degree, intending to join the family shipping empire. Archer provides a pitch-perfect continuation of the Clifton family saga; his shrewd twists and turns are addictive from the get-go, and he stuns with his signature series sign-off, a cliffhanger leaving readers longing for its resolution.

He argues that Jews throughout history demonstrated a savvy understanding of political life; they were neither as powerless as the memory of the Holocaust years would suggest nor as powerful as the as the contemporary state of Israel would imply.</p><p><b>DAVID BIALE&nbsp;</b>is the Koret Associate Professor of Jewish History and Director of the Center for Judaic Studies at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California. He won the JWB National Jewish Book Award in 1980 for his previous book, <i>Gershom Scholem: Kabbalah and Counter-History.</i><b><i>I</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> <b><i>Sovereignty and Imperialism in Antiquity</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> At the end of his great history of the Jewish revolt against Rome of 66-70 C.E., Josephus Flavius wrote:<br> &nbsp;<br> So fell Jerusalem in the second year of Vespasian&#x2019;s reign..., captured five times before and now for the second time laid utterly waste.... From King David, the first Jew to reign over it, to the destruction by Titus was 1,179 years. But neither its long history, nor its vast wealth, nor its people dispersed through the whole world, nor the unparalleled renown of its worship sufficed to avert its ruin.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thus, according to one view of Jewish history, ended the glorious age of Jewish sovereignty, not to be regained until the Zionist movement reestablished the state of Israel in 1948. The destruction of the Second Temple in 70 C.E. is commonly considered to demarcate the fundamental political watershed in Jewish history: the end of political independence and the beginning of the powerlessness of exile. The rabbis, who became the sole leaders of the nation in the wake of the revolt against Rome, instituted radical changes in the nature of Judaism. They not only constructed a religion without Temple sacrifices, but they are said to have abdicated all interest in politics and power in favor of a solely spiritual existence. It was this apolitical Judaism that became the Judaism of the Middle Ages, but the memory of the age of political power was preserved in messianism, the hope for the restoration of the golden age &#x201c;when the Temple still stood.&#x201d; <br> &nbsp;<br> This view of the ancient period and the role of the rabbis, so widely accepted in Jewish consciousness, is more romantic than historical. The golden age of Jewish power in antiquity is largely a myth based on exceptions instead of the norm: the political status of the Jews throughout most of antiquity was not full sovereignty but a partial and tenuous independence in an imperial world. For at least two centuries after the destruction of the Temple, the Jews in both the Land of Israel and the Diaspora were not powerless at all but in fact enjoyed forms of self-government similar in many ways to those of the Second Temple period. Rather than an abrupt shift from power to powerlessness, Jewish power in the early rabbinical period, and especially in the century after the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132-35 C.E.), was, if anything, greater than in most of the preceding ages. <br> &nbsp;<br> The destruction of the Temple dictated a religious revolution for the Jews, but its political meaning was more complex. It brought about a change in leadership from priests to rabbis, but the nature of Jewish power, both internally and in relation to the outside world, remained fundamentally the same. The rabbis built a much more durable political system than had any of the earlier leaders, whether tribal elders, kings, or priests, who were only partially successful in confronting an imperial world and in maintaining some partial semblance of Jewish sovereignty. Yet these earlier attempts, both in their successes and their failures, prepared the ground for the work of the rabbis, which in turn laid the foundations of Jewish life in the Middle Ages.</p><h2>Frontier Earth: Searcher</h2><p>In the sequel to Frontier Earth, the extraterrestrial being called Macklin continues his odyssey through the American West of the 1880s as he searches for the mystery of his true identity and struggles to fulfill his mission on Earth, while the predatory alien Kra&#39;agh attempt to hunt him down and kill him.</p><p>A native Midwesterner, <b>Bruce Boxleitner</b> received his formal acting training on the stage. He is an alumnus of Chicago's prestigious Goodman Theater. His first television appearance was a five-line part in "<b>The Mary Tyler Moore Show</b>." Since then, he has worked steadily in television, frequently in Westerns, and became known for his starring role in the popular series "<b>Scarecrow and Mrs. King</b>." In 1994, he assumed the role of Captain John Sheridan in the wildly popular science fiction series, "<b>Babylon 5</b>."Babylon 5 star Boxleitner beats the odds in this entertaining sequel to his first novel, Frontier Earth. Not only does this clever SF/western hybrid feature better pacing and characterizations (among them, Cissy, a plainspoken "soiled dove," and two articulate Apaches), but Boxleitner's rock-solid plotting drives home the old alien vs. human story by contrasting it with the Apache-white man conflicts in Arizona, circa 1882. The returning hero, Macklin, an Associative Monitor Corps member, is helping to protect a human society still in its formative stages from a predatory race known as the Kra'agh, savage, smelly aliens who want to turn Earth into their very own supermarket. During his first adventure on Earth, culminating at the infamous gunfight at the O.K. Corral, a partially amnesiac Macklin loses his fellow Monitor, Dorree, who leaves him to fight the Kra'agh alone while she seeks help off world. After a stint as an Earp gunslinger, Macklin feels more like a cowboy than a Monitor sworn to watch over primitive worlds. Later adventures lead him out of Tombstone to Tucson and eventually to Apache Peak and a sacred Apache mountain site, which also happens to contain the first alien hive for Kra'agh invasion forces. By humorously skewing western legends and showing respect for history by exercising restraint where he should, such as in his depiction of the Sunrise Ceremony/Gift of Changing Woman, Boxleitner succeeds in making this series one to watch with anticipation. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Red, White, and Blue Letter Days: An American Calendar</h2><p><p>The Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day, Columbus Day, Labor Day, Martin Luther King's Birthday, and other celebrations matter to Americans and reflect the state of American local and national politics. Commemorations of cataclysmic events and light, apparently trivial observances mirror American political and cultural life. Both reveal much about the material conditions of the United States and its citizens' identities, historical consciousness, and political attitudes. Lying dormant within these festivals is the potential for political consequence, controversy, even transformation. American political fetes remain works in progress, as Americans use historical celebrations as occasions to reinvent themselves and their nation, often with surprising results.

Independence Day invited African Americans to demand the equality promised in the Declaration of Independence, for example, just as Columbus Day&#x2015;celebrating the Italian, Catholic explorer&#x2015;helped immigrants proclaim their legitimacy as Americans. Native Americans too could use public holidays, such as Thanksgiving or Veterans Day, to express dissent or demonstrate their claims to citizenship. Merchants and advertisers colonized the American calendar, moving in to sell their products by linking them, often tenuously, with holiday occasions or casting consumption as a patriotic act.</p></p><p>"Red, White, and Blue Letter Days is an enormously ambitious, creative, well-written, and informative history of the most important and lasting American civic holidays.

The story line weaves through the seven mysteries, kicking off with a member of the Timson clan falsely accused of devil worship, sending Rumpole into a hostile child welfare court, and ending with Rumpole facing charges of unethical conduct.

Alongside the heroism and athleticism, he reveals the extraordinary amounts of chicanery, from pulling riders along to illicit drug use.

The book reports more than forty first-person accounts of individuals who died, went into the Spirit World, and then returned to mortality. Scientists call such events a near-death experience (NDE). Research has been undertaken on this subject in many studies during recent decades. These new accounts confirm past findings, but also report dramatic unexpected results which haven&#39;t been previously identified. The author conducted carefully structured interviews with individuals who had journeyed beyond the veil. The exact transcriptions of these interviews are presented in the first half of the book. Then, portions of the various accounts are compiled and analyzed for the doctrinal implications they contain. These two approaches combine to make this intriguing book a powerful witness that life continues after death and that death should not be feared. As one lady stated: &#34;Death is ... nothing to be feared. It&#39;s an awakening ...&#34; This book, prepared with careful observance of the principles of empirical research, is a major contribution to the field of near-death research. It also supplies answers to many LDS questions about entry into the Spirit World: life&#39;s purpose, the &#34;light&#34; and &#34;tunnel,&#34; the &#34;life review&#34; judgment before Jesus Christ, the power and love of God, and differing views of the spirit world and of human destiny. It suggests an eternal pain-free life filled with light, truth, knowledge, growth, creating, and exuberant joy.</p><p>Arvin Gibson has filled numerous teaching and service positions in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Eight costumed boys running to meet their friend Pipkin at the haunted house outside town encounter instead the huge and cadaverous Mr. Moundshroud. As Pipkin scrambles to join them, he is swept away by a dark Something, and Moundshroud leads the boys on the tail of a kite through time and space to search the past for their friend and the meaning of Halloween. After witnessing a funeral procession in ancient Egypt, cavemen discovering fire, Druid rites, the persecution of witches in the Dark Ages, and the gargoyles of Notre Dame, they catch up with the elusive Pipkin in the catacombs of Mexico, where each boy gives one year from the end of his life to save Pipkin&#39;s.

Or Ray Bradbury's classic <i>The Halloween Tree</i>. Eight boys set out on a Halloween night and are led into the depths of the past by a tall, mysterious character named Moundshroud. They ride on a black wind to autumn scenes in distant lands and times, where they witness other ways of celebrating this holiday about the dark time of year. Bradbury's lyrical prose whooshes along with the pell-mell rhythms of children running at night, screaming and laughing, and the reader is carried along by its sheer exuberance. <p> Bradbury's stories about children are always attended by dread--of change, adulthood, death. <i>The Halloween Tree</i>, while sweeter than his adult literature, is also touched at moments by the cold specter of loss--which is only fitting, of course, for a holiday in honor of the waning of the sun. </p><p> This is a superb book for adults to read to children, a way to teach them, quite painlessly, about customs and imagery related to Halloween from ancient Egypt, Mediterranean cultures, Celtic Druidism, Mexico, and even a cathedral in Paris. (One caveat, though: Bradbury unfortunately perpetuates a couple of misconceptions about <i>Samhain</i>, or summer's end, the Halloween of ancient Celts and contemporary pagans.)

But now, with an intense revival of interest in classical design, and with the demise in popularity of the subsequent postmodernism, new vigor has infused traditional forms and motifs. Focusing on approximately thirty projects by the best classically oriented firms in the United States and Britain, New Classicism examines this burgeoning new vogue for the many varieties of traditional classical design. <br>The result is a dazzling array of highly disciplined and high-profile classical designs, ranging from the exquisite work of John Blateau and Alan Greenberg's eighteenth-century-inspired reconfiguration of the interiors of the U.S. State Department to the Nashville public library designed by Robert A.

Dowling presents a wide variety of examples of the style in the book's many oversized photographs, from palatial homes and university buildings to a financial center in Washington, D.C., and a "Georgian Club" in Tokyo. In her introduction, the author celebrates the recent rebirth of Classicism in both the United States and Britain, while unabashedly expressing her distaste for modern design. She sets up a dichotomy between the two styles, tracing the rise of modern architecture in the past century in opposition to the classical tradition, which Dowling feels has suffered from a decline in popularity since the 1930s, "when many professors from the Bauhaus ... immigrated to America to escape persecution in Nazi Germany." Dowling then quickly moves on to mention those designers featured in the book who resisted the dominant modern aesthetic in the past half century, such as Allan Greenberg and John Blatteau. A professor of architecture at Georgia Institute of Technology and author of American Classicist: The Architecture of Phillip Trammell Schutze, Dowling also discusses the recent revival of classicism in the training of design. The bulk of the book is dedicated to profiles of 13 architects who have produced work in the New Classicist style since the late '80s, featuring rich photographs of their extravagant projects. This is a worthwhile read for those who pay attention to contemporary architecture. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now a senior writer at <i>SI,</i> Shipnuck writes regularly on golf. His first book, <i>Bud, Sweat, &amp; Tees,</i> was a national bestseller. He lives in Long Beach, California, with his wife and daughter.In June 2002, Martha Burk, chair of the National Council of Women's Organizations, sent a nine-sentence letter to the Augusta National Golf Club-host of the prestigious Masters tournament-asking it to review its policy of barring women from club membership. The unexpectedly long and harsh response of club chairman "Hootie" Johnson to Burk's short letter sparked a yearlong battle of wills that quickly became a national controversy. Shipnuck (<i>Bud, Sweat and Tees</i>), a senior writer at <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, superbly recounts all of the debacle's hilarious, sad, serious and absurd details. His overall view is that "Everybody lost" in a battle in which "both sides are right" in "a binary argument": the Constitution allows Augusta's right to decide its membership, at the same time that Augusta's policy is inappropriate since it is part of a golf world governed by a nondiscrimination policy. No one really looks good in this story, although Shipnuck shows how Johnson clearly tarnished the image of the Masters and became a poster child for discrimination, while Burk merely let her aggressive protests fizzle out over time. He saves his scorn for others: the "scheming PR flack" hired by Augusta who used the controversy to benefit his career; the members of the media who used Johnson and Burk to push their own agendas; and such golf stars as Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods (whom Shipnuck definitively shows to be "a middle-aged white guy at heart"), who ran away from addressing Augusta's intolerance. He too often uncritically quotes conservatives like Mickey Kaus, but Shipnuck clearly captures the pros and cons of the battle for Augusta. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Book opened, but never used.</p><p></p><h2>We Jews and Jesus: Exploring Theological Differences for Mutual Understanding</h2><p><p><b>An important contribution to the welcome growth of <br>religious understanding and cooperation between Jews and Christians. </b></p><p>Filled with warm sympathy for Christianity but also with sturdy intellectual honesty and loyalty to Judaism, this classic work continues to clearly and forcefully guide both Christians and Jews in timely, relevant discussion of the relationships between their faiths. Examining the Jewish views on Jesus throughout history and today, Rabbi Samuel Sandmel introduces the perspective of a rabbi of the liberal wing of Judaism, and presents the scholarship of the last century and a half as pursued by both Christians and Jews. </p><p>Without prejudice but admittedly partisan, this book explains why Jesus is of cultural and historical interest to Jews, though not of direct religious interest. It drives home one of the most important lessons of our time&#x2015;that Christians and Jews can be worlds apart theologically, but also very close in mutual understanding and in cooperation toward desirable human goals. </p></p><p>Significant portions of the world's Jews have lived, or are living, as minorities in predominantly Christian societies. They have, therefore, always been affected by the figure of Jesus. For much of Jewish history this has meant finding ways to respond to Christians who wondered why Jews did not accept Jesus the Jew as the Messiah prophesied about in the Scriptures. The nature of the responses Jews have given to this question varies greatly and has been influenced by both the intellectual climate of their time and the position of Jews within the larger society. <p> This classic reprint explores what Jews have thought and written about Jesus throughout history and how contemporary Jews, informed by modern critical scriptural scholarship, might think of Jesus today. Written in a non-technical way for the layperson, Rabbi Sandmel examines how Jewish views of Jesus provide valuable perspectives on how Jews have thought about themselves, their religion and their relationship with the broader world. He traces the history of how Jews have described Jesus, highlights what can be learned from modern scholarship and suggests how Jews might view Christianity in light of what has been learned over the centuries.</p><p><strong>Rabbi Samuel Sandmel</strong> was professor of Bible and Hellenistic literature at Hebrew Union College&#x2013;Jewish Institute of Religion, and was author of many highly regarded books in the field of Jewish and Bible studies.</p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Yiddish Wisdom for Marriage</h2><p>This beautifully illustrated treasury of Jewish wedding proverbs celebrates the joys - and adventures - of sharing your life with the one you love.

With charming watercolors by Kristina Swarner to illuminate the proverbs, this initimate volume is a delightful inspiration and the perfect gift. Not what is beautiful is loved, but what is loved is beautiful. Nit dos vos iz sheyn iz lib, nor dos vos iz lib iz sheyn. When the heart is full, the eyes overflow. Az dos harts iz ful, veln di oygn aribergisn. When he loves his wife he also loves her family. Az men hot lib dos vayb hot men oykh lib ir mishpokhe. The first fight is the best fight. Der ershter broygez iz der bester broygez.</p><p>Kristina Swarner is the illustrator of Yiddish Wisdom and Yiddish Wisdom for Parents. She lives in Chicago.

He is currently working on the ABC line of comics, which also includes Tomorrow Stories, Promethea, Top Ten and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (all published by Titan). Art Adams is a widely respected artist who has worked on many major titles, including Hellboy, Danger Girl, Gen 13, Tom Strong&#39;s Terrific Tales and X-Men.Tom Strong's <i>Terrific Tales</i> consists of stories that spotlight Tom's family and friends, flash back to Tom's childhood on the island of Attaban Teru, and star an unrelated superheroine, Jonni Future. The stories written by Moore and centered on Tom are the solidest achievements here, and they are more playful than those in <i>Tom Strong</i>. Moore uses the short story format (none of these exceeds a dozen pages) to spring shaggy-dog endings on us and experiment with storytelling devices (one strip is told entirely through Tom Strong trading cards). The playfulness continues in the contributions of artists atypical of the series. In a wacky strip drawn by -alternative-comics titan Jaime Hernandez (<i>Love and Rockets</i>), Tom's daughter sneaks out of the house for an interplanetary night out. Elsewhere, <i>Mad</i>'s Sergio Aragones illustrates a day in the life of King Solomon that includes a melancholy zoo visit. Short stories were the norm in comics until the 1960s. Today's creators have largely lost the knack for brevity that, as <i>Terrific Tales</i> shows, still has its good uses. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright ï¿½ American Library Association.

Estï¿½relle Payany shares to-die-for recipes inspired by scoundrels from popular literature. Each chapter opens with an excerpt from the original story and quirky illustrations by Jean-Franï¿½ois Martin featuring the criminal and his recipe. The Big Bad Wolf roasts three little pigs in their blankets while Snow White&#x2019;s stepmother concocts bewitching caramel apples. The Queen of Hearts orders Alice to eat treacle tart while Long John Silver stocks the galley with sea biscuits.

Children will readily identify the familiar objects, such as crackers, quilt blocks, buckles, boxes, a brownie, and a book. It's a clean-cut collection, as a square button boldly asserts itself amid an assortment of round ones, and a round doorknob on a house provides enough contrast to keep the composition engaging.

Her work is published around the world.</p>This slight volume belies the depth of emotion conveyed within, as children's and YA author Block (Dangerous Angels, etc.) invites the reader to peer into her heart and mind during the first year after the birth of her first child. She's penned a lyrical, poetic vision of the early moments and months that are so precious and hard to describe. That the story (mostly) glosses over the monotonous work of child-rearing and the moments of frustration and anxiety is beside the point; other books provide solace for the new mother who needs to know she's not the only one who isn't enchanted by every single moment. For those who are enchanted, or for those who are dealing with the challenges of older children and wish to revisit the fleeting first year through rose-tinted glasses, Block enlightens with lines such as, "It felt like being in love for the first time. I wanted to woo her... I wanted the magic charm of fabrics and colors to transform me into a mother worthy of my daughter." She describes their adventures in parks and yoga classes and the rare moments when she learns to separate from the baby, having manicures, rediscovering her relationship with her husband and getting back to her work in writing this book.

If I'm speakingwith third graders, I ask them, 'Where would I go if I wanted to find out what it's like to be athird grader?' Most will say, 'Read a book.'

(no); ``Did you have to have a job waiting for you?'' (again, no; in fact, it was not allowed). It's evident that America has always been a polyglot magnet--even in 1643, 18 languages were spoken in one colonial area. It's also evident that there's been long-standing prejudice against certain immigrants (ability to read was required for entrance, and first and second class arrivals didn't have to sweat it out at Ellis Island). Perhaps most interesting here are the individual stories: the name change in the author's own family; the child who had never seen a banana and ate it whole; the ``six- second'' medical exam. Levine (If You Traveled West in a Covered Wagon, 1986) gives multiculturalism an extra boost by ending with a sampling of words and other contributions from many heritages. Nostalgically warm impressionistic paintings, suffused with sepia, simultaneously signal suffering and hope. (Nonfiction. 7-10) -- <i>Copyright ï¿½1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Arguing with God is a highly original and utterly absorbing study that skates along the edge of this theological thin ice_at times verging dangerously close to blasphemy_yet also a source of some of the most poignant and deeply soulful expressions of human anguish and yearning. The name Israel literally denotes one who &#39;wrestles with God.&#39; And, from Jacob&#39;s battle with the angel to Elie Wiesel&#39;s haunting questions about the Holocaust that hang in the air like still smoke over our own age, Rabbi Laytner admirably details Judaism&#39;s rich and pervasive tradition of calling God to task over human suffering and experienced injustice. It is a tradition that originated in the biblical period itself. Abraham, Moses, Elijah, and others all petitioned for divine intervention in their lives, or appealed forcefully to God to alter His proposed decree. Other biblical arguments focused on personal or communal suffering and anger: Jeremiah, Job, and certain Psalms and Lamentations. Rabbi Laytner delves beneath the surface of these &#39;blasphemies&#39; and reveals how they implicitly helped to refute the claims of opponent religions and advance Jewish doctrines and teachings.</p><p>Anson H. Laytner is Director of the Jewish Federation Community Relations Council of Greater Seattle. He is the editor of Points East, the periodical of the Sino-Judaic Institute, and has written The Wheels of Observance: A Growth Guide to the Jewish Holidays.

From correspondence a version appears to have been distributed in 1513, using a Latin title, De Principatibus (About Principalities). However, the printed version was not published until 1532, five years after Machiavelli's death. This was done with the permission of the Medici pope Clement VII, but "long before then, in fact since the first appearance of the Prince in manuscript, controversy had swirled about his writings".Although it was written as if it were a traditional work in the mirrors for princes style, it is generally agreed that it was especially innovative. This is only partly because it was written in the vernacular Italian rather than Latin, a practice which had become increasingly popular since the publication of Dante's Divine Comedy and other works of Renaissance literature.The Prince is sometimes claimed to be one of the first works of modern philosophy, especially modern political philosophy, in which the effective truth is taken to be more important than any abstract ideal. It was also in direct conflict with the dominant Catholic and scholastic doctrines of the time concerning how to consider politics and ethics.Although it is relatively short, the treatise is the most remembered of Machiavelli's works and the one most responsible for bringing the word "Machiavellian" into usage as a pejorative. It also helped make "Old Nick" an English term for the devil, and even contributed to the modern negative connotations of the words "politics" and "politician" in western countries. In terms of subject matter it overlaps with the much longer Discourses on Livy, which was written a few years later. In its use of near-contemporary Italians as examples of people who perpetrated criminal deeds for politics, another lesser-known work by Machiavelli which The Prince has been compared to is the Life of Castruccio Castracani.The descriptions within The Prince have the general theme of accepting that the aims of princes&#x2014;such as glory and survival&#x2014;can justify the use of immoral means to achieve those ends.&#x201c;He who neglects what is done for what ought to be done, sooner effects his ruin than his preservation.&#x201d;&#x2014;Machiavelli, "Chapter 15"</p><p>When Lorenzo de' Medici seized control of the Florentine Republic in 1512, he summarily fired the Secretary to the Second Chancery of the Signoria and set in motion a fundamental change in the way we think about politics. The person who held the aforementioned office with the tongue-twisting title was none other than Niccolï¿½ Machiavelli, who, suddenly finding himself out of a job after 14 years of patriotic service, followed the career trajectory of many modern politicians into punditry. Unable to become an on-air political analyst for a television network, he only wrote a book. But what a book <i>The Prince</i> is. Its essential contribution to modern political thought lies in Machiavelli's assertion of the then revolutionary idea that theological and moral imperatives have no place in the political arena. "It must be understood," Machiavelli avers, "that a prince ... cannot observe all of those virtues for which men are reputed good, because it is often necessary to act against mercy, against faith, against humanity, against frankness, against religion, in order to preserve the state." With just a little imagination, readers can discern parallels between a 16th-century principality and a 20th-century presidency. <i>--Tim Hogan</i>Here is the world's most famous master plan for seizing and holding power. Astonishing in its candor <i>The Prince</i> even today remains a disturbingly realistic and prophetic work on what it takes to be a prince . . . a king . . . a president. When, in 1512, Machiavelli was removed from his post in his beloved Florence, he resolved to set down a treatise on leadership that was practical, not idealistic. In <i>The Prince</i> he envisioned would be unencumbered by ordinary ethical and moral values; his prince would be man and beast, fox and lion. Today, this small sixteenth-century masterpiece has become essential reading for every student of government, and is the ultimate book on power politics.</p><h2>Lacrosse Team Strategies: The New Offense - Defense System</h2><p>Book by Hinkson, Jim</p><p></p><h2>Cooking with Johnny Vee: International Cuisine with a Modern Flair</h2><p><p>With its rich culinary history, Santa Fe, serves as Mecca for "foodies" worldwide and Chef and Las Cosas Cooking School Director, Johnny Vee, is no exception.

He customizes programs for special groups of people: pregnant women, overweight people, recovering alcoholics and drug abusers, those dealing with or overcoming heart problems, former cancer sufferers, people over 65, and a dozen other categories. <br><br>Building on the breakthrough thinking of <b>Spontaneous Healing</b> and drawing on the experiences of patients who have adopted his program, Dr. Weil's <b>Eight Weeks to Optimum Health</b> provides an invaluable means to maintain health and lessen the need for medical intervention.</p><p>"Health," Dr. Andrew Weil writes, "is a dynamic and temporary state of equilibrium destined to break down as conditions change." In other words, there's no such thing as the type of health that allows you to feel equally great every day of your life. Instead, Weil suggests, your goal should be to improve your resilience to disease, and while you're at it, feel more joy and strength.<p> As to how you should gain this strength, joy, and resilience, Weil doesn't come on with a hard sell to give up every bad habit or all of the foods you enjoy. Instead, he suggests gradual changes: clean your pantry of whatever cooking oils you have there, except olive oil; start taking vitamin C three times a day; walk a few minutes a day; eat some fish and broccoli. The program is so simple and sensible that anyone trying it probably will feel better in a week.</p><p> The program then gets progressively more involved--more supplements; more of a shift toward a diet based on whole grains, fruits, and vegetables; more exercise. Besides these steady changes, each week's program has a focus: In week 2, you start drinking bottled or filtered water; week 3 focuses on organic produce; week 4, on sleep; week 5, using a steam bath or sauna; week 6, trying a "universal tonic" like ginseng; week 7, volunteering in your community; and finally, in week 8, figuring out how to integrate permanently the elements of the program into your life. </p><p> Even those who don't go for the entire program will probably find something here to like--the recipes, maybe, or the suggestion that you cut back on strenuous types of exercise like running and competitive sports in favor of brisk walks. It's perfectly useful either way: as a total lifestyle overhaul, or a series of suggestions, any one or two of which will probably help you feel better. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>When my mother went on the Sugarbusters diet recently, she had made a decision to change not only her eating habits, but her physical exercise habits as well.

A man in a white cap moved about on deck. Blinding white boats floated at their moorings a long way out under a hot cloudless sky. Kat took off her cotton blazer and nudged off her dressy shoes under the table. Her sister, Jacki, sat across from her, marine-blue eyes hidden by huge sunglasses, lipsticked, wearing a sleeveless blouse that overhung her eight-months-along middle like a steep-eaved roof. &#x201c;Have a good morning?&#x201d; Jacki asked.<br><br>&#x201c;The usual schizoid Sunday in August. I read the paper in my jammies and enjoyed myself until I made the mistake of returning a business phone call and had this knockdown fight with one very angry owner in La Cienega who thought his house should be worth double my appraisal. Sorry I&#x2019;m late. I couldn&#x2019;t find legal parking so I&#x2019;ll probably get towed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The walk nearly killed me.&#x201d; Jacki lived right here in Marina del Rey, only two blocks away in a loft condo with her husband, Raoul, who taught bioethics and biology at UCLA. Kat couldn&#x2019;t afford this area on one income, so lived several miles south in Hermosa Beach.<br><br>&#x201c;Braggart. I should have had a margarita instead of this latte,&#x201d; Kat said, taking a sip. &#x201c;Things always go better with tequila.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You drink too much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So do you when you&#x2019;re not pregnant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Already the low blows,&#x201d; Jacki said comfortably, offering her a napkin, &#x201c;and you&#x2019;ve only been here&#x201d;&#x2013;she consulted her watch&#x2013;&#x201c;three minutes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You started it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So I should get the last word.&#x201d;<br><br>Kat nodded. &#x201c;Always end as you start. I remember that from the one creative writing course I took at Long Beach State.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I ordered a turkey on rye for you, okay?&#x201d;<br><br>Kat nodded again, taking the napkin and setting it beside her plate. She made a note to herself to stop for a bottle of wine on the way home. Evenings had been much easier to get through lately, what with this new habit of getting slightly shitfaced every night. Yes, later she would undoubtedly violate the Buddha&#x2019;s Fifth Precept against intoxicants once again this evening, because she didn&#x2019;t seem to have any control over anything anymore, but the main thing was to be on the path and do the best you can at any given moment. She was drinking coffee right now and not hurting anything, not engaged in any sexual misconduct, not stealing, not getting whacked on chardonnay, piling up merit to piss away later tonight.<br><br>Jacki had just started her maternity leave, and she was becoming quite irksome now that she didn&#x2019;t have a job on which to expend her prodigious energies. She called Kat a half-dozen times a day.<br><br>Leaning back in the blue-trimmed wicker chair, Kat decided she didn&#x2019;t really mind. In fact, she didn&#x2019;t have much of a life outside her work and Jacki these days. Her sister&#x2019;s phone calls gave her a sense of normality. &#x201c;I love the air here,&#x201d; she said, breathing deeply, as a sea breeze swept across the patio. &#x201c;I heard it was a hundred and eight in San Bernardino yesterday. Imagine being there next month, in September, when it really gets hot. We&#x2019;re lucky, living on the coast. They say being near large bodies of water makes the air heavier or something and so it&#x2019;s healthier for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fewer cooties is what I hear.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ask Raoul, and be sure to use the word &#x2018;cooties.&#x2019; He knows all that special science stuff.&#x201d; Kat checked out the nearby tables, but they were full of women just like her and Jacki at this time of day. The pasty and pudgy waiter wasn&#x2019;t hot. His dress shirt gaped enough to display part of a blue tattoo she really didn&#x2019;t want to see the rest of. It took the pressure off, not having to be aware of him or to wonder what he thought of her.<br><br>&#x201c;Hey, you know, Kat,&#x201d; Jacki was saying, waving her hand at the cloudless sky and ocean beyond, &#x201c;if we have no other legacy when we die, at least they can say we got the hell out of Whittier.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s such a Whittier thing to say,&#x201d; Kat said.<br><br>They laughed. They had grown up in a two-story house with a living/dining combo, three bedrooms, and windows closed off at all times with dark drapes against the hot, dusty outside. The town had become a scapegoat for them. Once there had been orange groves, times their parents nostalgically remembered, before their time, before the World War II vets arrived with their new wives and big families, hungry for safe, cheap housing. The old Quaker town thirty miles inland became just another suburb bursting with tract houses, absorbed into the basin-wide suburb which was L.A.<br><br>&#x201c;If Daddy had only let us fix the place up&#x2013;get some&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A/c,&#x201d; Kat finished. &#x201c;God, what he inflicted on us, and I don&#x2019;t mean his sense of humor.&#x201d; Kat and Jacki both kept their condos frosty in summer. They would go without food before they would give up air-conditioning.<br><br>&#x201c;Remember? He said it was to save the earth when what he was really doing was saving to buy the girlfriend a Camaro,&#x201d; Jacki said.<br><br>&#x201c;Which she took with her. We never thanked her enough for leaving him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You did pretty well. Even Ma got a kick out of those roses you sent her,&#x201d; said Jacki.<br><br>But for months after her husband left and again after their brother, Tom, died, their mother had just sat dully on her couch, exuding, in that dim overhot room, the familiar smell of what Kat secretly called Eau de Dumped, the smell of the lonely women of Southern California. No emollients, no deodorant could disguise that stink of loneliness.<br><br>I ought to take a whiff of my own armpits, Kat thought glumly, and tasted the hot milky drink the waiter had just brought.<br><br>In her working life as a realtor, Jacki had always appeared supremely coifed and styled. Today she wore her streaked hair snapped into a clip, the dark roots shiny and clean but untreated. Her skin looked pinker these days, no doubt due to the pregnancy, but the color didn&#x2019;t hide the million freckles she usually erased with foundation. Kat said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re starting to look just like Ma when we were little. I expect you to say, any second now, &#x2018;Pick your nose again and I&#x2019;m calling the cops.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Jacki swatted at her.<br><br>&#x201c;You said you wanted to talk to me about something?&#x201d; Kat asked.<br><br>But Jacki, relaxed since leaving her job and under the spell of a modified endocrine system heavy on the maternal hormones, appeared in no hurry to discuss whatever was bugging her. &#x201c;I ordered myself a salad, nothing heavy. I&#x2019;ll graze like the enormous hippo I have become and continue with meal number six of the day when Raoul gets home. You have plans tonight?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not really, no.&#x201d; Unless maybe getting laid by someone Kat had not yet met counted as making plans. His name was Nikola and he had a promising twinkle in his eye, at least in the one-inch shot he had posted on Match.com. They were on for dinner at a bistro in Hermosa.<br><br>&#x201c;What do you do for fun these days?&#x201d; Jacki asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Work sixteen hours a day, as you well know. I looked at six houses today desperately seeking comps for an old thirties shack on the beach at Zuma that only has one bathroom.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Some fun,&#x201d; Jacki said. She too had always worked long hours, but somehow had found time to date her husband, cook elegant dinners, host quasi-scintillating friends, see all the latest movies and concerts, and it seemed, organize good weather wherever she went. Now, she would have her baby at age thirty-six, just like she had always planned. &#x201c;So how much did you decide it was worth?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A million three. A teardown.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s listing it?&#x201d; They talked about their favorite subject, residential real estate, for a few minutes. Kat worked as an appraiser, comparing ineffables. Jacki was a realtor. Real estate cluttered up their genes, and besides, with the market smokin&#x2019; as it was, they were both making enough money to live and sock away a little, and to hope for <i>The Big Lebowski</i>, the monster hit, to come someday and wipe out all their financial insecurities.<br><br>Jacki was definitely working up to something, Kat could tell by the thoughtful way she dropped her ice cube in her coffee and swished it around. Finally she cocked an eyebrow and said far too casually, &#x201c;What happened to that Internet guy you were dating?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That didn&#x2019;t work out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Really? You said the sex was so hot and he had the potential to become real someday.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I never.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You implied it.&#x201d; Jacki&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t even remember who I&#x2019;m talking about, do you? How many men do you see in a given month?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Make up your mind, willya? First you insinuate I&#x2019;m a drudge. Now you&#x2019;re mad that I do just wanna have fun.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, intervention time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Kat, you have to be careful. It&#x2019;s crazy&#x2013;in these times&#x2013;for you to be running around like a . . . like a . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hooker too stupid to demand her money up front?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You prowl mindlessly. It&#x2019;s not going to get you a man who loves you and wants to spend the rest of his life with you. You have to know that.&#x201d; Lunch plates appeared. Jacki hunkered down to her Shrimp Louis, crunching loudly, not like a single woman, but like a complacent one.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re just jealous, stuck for life with an accomplished egghead who loves you madly,&#x201d; Kat said.<br><br>&#x201c;Take the advice of your wise older sister, who, yes, figured out what it takes to be happy. And it isn&#x2019;t all Raoul&#x2019;s doing, I&#x2019;ll have you know. A person has to achieve a certain integration of self.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know it all, big sister.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I do know a few things&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re getting smug.&#x201d;<br><br>Jacki smacked her hand down on the table, spilling a few shreds of dressing&#x2013;soaked lettuce. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m worried, okay? I can&#x2019;t tell you what&#x2019;s going to make you happy. I know what makes me happy: a solid relationship. I love Raoul. He holds me up. I don&#x2019;t have to spend all my time trying to find renters to lodge in my heart, like you do. You exhaust yourself and you waste your time being unhappy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How else am I going to find love? I don&#x2019;t know anybody in my condo development. I quit going to church when I was fourteen; going clubbing alone is dangerous. I don&#x2019;t have friends except you&#x2013;at least, you were my friend up to five minutes ago. I&#x2019;m rethinking that now. Everybody meets online these days. It&#x2019;s safer than you might think.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I figured it out,&#x201d; Jacki said, with the infuriating gaze of an older sister who <i>had </i>figured it out. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know what will make you happy, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re about to let me know, though, aren&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Kat&#x2019;s turkey sandwich was huge enough to satisfy King Kong, and was accompanied by a vast pile of fries. Kat poured on the ketchup, hungry.<br><br>Her sister speared a soggy shrimp, her steady chewing implacable. &#x201c;Well, do you? Know?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br><br>Jacki put her fork down and folded her arms. &#x201c;Okay, then. What will make you happy?&#x201d;<br><br>Kat said, &#x201c;Questions are demands, did you know that? Like e&#x2013;mails. You have the right not to respond. In fact, I recommend that strategy. You can&#x2019;t imagine how annoyed people get when you don&#x2019;t respond to e&#x2013;mails; ergo, fewer e&#x2013;mails, fewer demands on your time. In other words just because you ask doesn&#x2019;t mean I have to tell you.&#x201d;<br><br>Jacki smiled evilly. &#x201c;Meaning you don&#x2019;t know the answer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s insulting, you implying I&#x2019;m unhappy, you know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me you&#x2019;re happy. With a straight face.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Quit nagging, Jacki.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like you said, I&#x2019;m your only friend. It&#x2019;s what friends do. Plus, hey, I brought you something. Damn, where did I put that thing? I cut it out for you.&#x201d; She pulled out an enormous wad of cash, receipts, gum wrappers, hard candy, coins, and pens from her tiny Chinese silk purse and sorted through it. &#x201c;Guess I forgot it,&#x201d; she said, stuffing everything back in somehow. &#x201c;It was in the <i>Times</i> real estate section last week, this article about a mansion being built at Laguna Cliffs. Ultramodern, you know, mucho concrete-o, geometric palm trees, and an infinity pool. Probably list at around four and a half million.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s being designed by her husband. Leigh Hubbel&#x2019;s. Remember, we heard he was an architect? Now I can&#x2019;t remember his name&#x2013;sort of common like Jones or Johnson. Shoot. His firm is doing really well. They designed the new history museum in Pasadena, the one with the Native American mummy. Did you know the Chumash buried people in urns, all curled up in a sitting position?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No stranger than draining their blood and replacing it with fixative, putting makeup on their poor dead faces, stretching them out in a coffin in some fine outfit, then burying them surrounded by concrete.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Geez,&#x201d; Jacki said, placing a hand on her tummy. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve given this entirely too much thought. So listen, to return to my actual point, Leigh&#x2019;s husband is described in the news as the next Hockney.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I doubt that. Hockney&#x2019;s the artist, the swimming pool painter, photo-pastiche master. Could you mean Michael Graves?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s our man. I swear&#x201d;&#x2013;Jacki stretched down and rubbed her foot&#x2013;&#x201c;all the blood flow gets hijacked down to here.&#x201d; She tapped her stomach. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t think straight anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Did you ever?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But let me tell you, the universe is conspiring and even you should listen when that happens. It must say something in your Buddha studies about how the universe tells you things and you should listen.&#x201d; Jacki, who attended a Quaker church, treated Leigh&#x2019;s interest in Buddhism as an aberrant phase.<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t got to that part yet, I guess.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anyway, last Friday I went to the cemetery. You know, it&#x2019;s been six years since he died?&#x201d; She wiped away a sudden tear as easily as someone brushing off a fly.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, Jacki. Was that such a good idea?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t make me sad. It makes me happy to visit him and the folks. You never go, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>Kat did go at times, although never with her sister. She had marked that awful anniversary in private again this year, at home where she could howl into a pillow observed only by the birds outside her window. Death made her so angry. She would never make her peace with it, never.<br><br>&#x201c;Anyway, I wasn&#x2019;t the only one, turns out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I was gathering up a bunch of chrysanthemums from the back seat, and who should I see in the car window?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You saw Leigh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d; Jacki sat back, smiling as if delivering a wonderful gift. &#x201c;I got out as quick as I could, but she took off. It takes me a long time to get out of a car these days, you know. Anyway, I thought she looked like hell, haggard, her eyes all swelled up. I know she saw me, but she left anyway. When I got to Tommy&#x2019;s grave, I found the most beautiful bouquet of irises. She must have left them there. He liked them, remember?&#x201d;<br><br>The bouquet of irises in his kitchen had wilted and died by the time Kat and Jacki had gone to clean out his apartment. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You two used to be close.

Her second book, <i>Bitch</i> is a celebration of the defiant, rock &amp; roll spirit of self-destructive women through the ages: Delilah, Amy Fisher, Princess Di, and hundreds more (including the awesomely reckless Wurtzel). There is no comprehensible central line of argument, perhaps because the author did her exhaustive research and writing on a speedy Kerouacesque drug binge that, by her own admission, sent her to rehab upon the book's conclusion. But Wurtzel has the remains of a fine mind: her insights are often sharp, sometimes bitchy, and always shameless as she zooms in a very few pages from <i>The Oresteia</i> to O.J. to her first crush on a fictional character (Heathcliff) to Jim Thompson's <i>The Killer Inside Me</i>, Richard Pryor, Chrissie Hynde, <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i>, <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, Sylvia Plath's "Daddy," <i>Schindler's List</i>, <i>Oliver!</i>, <i>Carousel</i>, and Andrea Dworkin. Most pop culture pundits incline to grandiose blather, but Wurtzel is punchy, and her quotes are more often apt than pretentious. <i>Bitch</i> is like a Mr. Toad's Wild Ride in a library, with frequent rampages through the film and music archives. Like rock music, Wurtzel's prose style lives for the moment. She glories in breaking rules to bits, is never giddier than when she's saying something shocking, and apparently has no moral code except self-expression--with the attitude volume knob cranked up to 11. <i>--Tim Appelo</i>Praise for <i>Prozac Nation:</i><p>"Sparkling, luminescent prose...by turns wrenching and comical, self-indulgent and self-aware, <i>Prozac Nation</i> possesses the raw candor of Joan Didion's essays, the irritating emotional exhibitionism of Sylvia Plath's <i>Bell Jar,</i> the wry, dark humor of a Bob Dylan song...a powerful portrait of one girl's journey through the purgatory of depression and back."<br>--Michiko Kakutani, <i>New York Times</i></p><p>"Thoughtful...Very brave...like all provocateurs, she poses questions which make you think." <br><i>--Vanity Fair</i></p><p>"<i>Prozac Nation</i> gives a view of every aspect of depression: the self-pity, the courage, the flashes of insight, the despair, and the endless, very moving struggle, simply, to live."<br>--Jeffrey Eugenides, author of <i>The Virgin Suicides</i></p></p><h2>Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith The Debunking of a Myth</h2><p>Fifty years ago Prime Minister Ian Douglas Smith and the Rhodesian Front party declared independence from Great Britain unilaterally. A decision which was viewed at that time as being both brave and foolish, it gave Rhodesians of all races seven years of peace and prosperity. Thereafter there followed a banker-financed terrorist war for an equivalent number of years. In 1980 Rhodesia became Zimbabwe and experienced twenty years of modest progress before plunging into an abyss, from which it is unlikely to emerge for a very long time. In the 1970s Rhodesia was the second most industrialised country in Africa, the bread basket of the central African region and possessed of one of the most highly educated and trained indigenous people in the less developed world. And then it all went wrong. This book explains the origins of this tragedy, the treachery of the British government, the behind the scenes treason of persons in high places and the insidious role played by Ian Smith in Rhodesia&#x2019;s demise, which has been to the long term detriment of all her people.</p><p></p><h2>American Samplers</h2><p>This is an EXACT reproduction of a book published before 1923.

The ArtistEdward Hopper began <i>Nighthawks</i> in December 1941, shortly after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. How difficult to imagine: like photographing a flower garden on the afternoon of September 11, 2001, not because a flower garden expressed certain feelings about the cataclysmic events of that morning, but because photographing flower gardens is your thing, is what you would have done anyway. While the country as a whole, pretty much overnight, committed itself to total war, "Ed," as his wife, Josephine "Jo" Hopper, recorded in her journal, "refusedto take any interest in our very likely prospect of being bombed ... . He's doing a new canvas and simply can't be interrupted."Come what may, devotion to a self-imposed task evokes the archetypal American hero: Think of John Wayne in John Ford's 1956 classic western, <i>The Searchers,</i> striding across an arid Texas landscape for seven long years in quest of Scar, the Comanche who kidnapped and ravished his niece. He has put all else aside, cares only about doing what he knows is one absolutely right thing to do. Or think of Raymond Chandler's obstinately moral private detective, Philip Marlowe, who takes on cases with little chance of payment--he may even refuse payment because he cannot be bought, committed as he is to the interests of his client (even when that so-called client hasn't actually hired him or attempts to halt his investigation). He gets a job done and done well because it is his duty, however ridiculous he seems when everyone else is for sale because that's the best way to get by. So the fifty-nine-year-old Hopper, world war or no world war, meticulously developed a scene based on a Greenwich Avenue restaurant that he spotted during one of his meandering strolls through lower Manhattan.He had labored in obscurity for some two decades following his graduation from the New York School of Art in 1906, supporting himself by illustrating advertisements, magazine articles, and movie posters. He despised this work and refused to do it more than three days per week to save time for his more personal artistic endeavors, but received scant attention for the few group shows he participated in. He was invited to contribute to the "Exhibition of Paintings and Drawings by Contemporary American Artists" in 1908, along with such up-and-comers as George Bellows and Rockwell Kent. But while the other artists displayed American views, Hopper--somewhat perversely, giventhe exhibition's stated theme--chose to display paintings inspired by a recent sojourn in Europe (mainly Paris), where he had traveled to visit museums and round out his education. He was duly ignored by the press. Not quite unjustly: The work was too derivative of French impressionism, which he greatly admired. Perhaps he needed the failure, the ensuing isolation, to keep to his own course, mature his style, and find his artistic identity.He made some notable breakthroughs. The massive (36" ï¿½ 72") near-masterpiece <i>Soir Bleu</i> (1914) portrays a voluptuous, heavily made-up prostitute surveying the customers in a Parisian cafï¿½ through narrowed eyes. She might be a demon searching for a soul worth stealing, and presages Hopper's career-long fascination with the enticements of very shapely women. <i>New York Corner</i> (1913) shows a group of faceless men in black hats and overcoats milling in front of a corner saloon on a gray, wintry day, the ice blue silhouette of a factory in the distance. At once ordinary and desolate, the painting won him some early praise when exhibited in 1915.Wider recognition did not come until 1923, when he exhibited a series of brilliant watercolors at the Brooklyn Museum, done in and around the picturesque town of Gloucester, Massachusetts. These paintings dovetailed nicely with critics' increasing interest in often idealized American settings done in a plainly realistic (i.e., not avant-garde, not European, and hold the flourishes) style. Now in his forties, Hopper suddenly achieved renown as a portrayer of the "American scene." In 1930, the Whitney Museum of American Art paid the then-impressive sum of $3,000 for <i>Early Sunday Morning</i> (1930). This aggressively mundane, if sunny, depiction of a block-long redbrick row building with a barber pole, fire hydrant, and a strip of pale blue sky above but no people in sight, makes for a vision so silent andstill it suggests some mysterious vitality, the existence of which we are but latently aware and cannot name.Hopper's reputation grew. In 1933, the Museum of Modern Art hosted his first retrospective. But recognition, even on this scale, did not compromise what critic Lloyd Goodrich called Hopper's "unwavering integrity" and "consistency," his almost defiant sense of himself as cleaving to a singular vocation, however propitious (or not) the trends might be. He would not give in to the art market any more than he gave in to the market for commercial illustration, which he would never again resort to. He continued to work slowly, completing only a few oils per year, always waiting until he was certain he had a fresh idea and would not be repeating himself. And he continued to spend a long time on each canvas, thinking a project through thoroughly before stubbornly painting and repainting, until he got precisely the intended effect (he liked working in oil, he said, because it facilitated "corrections and changes"). As the Great Depression continued, sales dropped off, and he faced financial strain, Hopper seemed to become even more selective, more afraid of simply coasting, of having nothing left to say.When Hopper did get going again, it was 1940, and the war in Europe took up much of the public's attention (Germany conquered France in June of that year), but he was entering arguably the most powerful phase of his career. Six weeks after Pearl Harbor, he completed what critics often point to as his most accomplished painting, one the artist himself counted as a favorite. <i>Nighthawks,</i> unlike many twentieth-century masterpieces, has won admiration from those who champion the often inaccessible experiments that make up much of modern art, as well as those that do not. This is in many respects a deeply cold and alien work, despite its immediately recognizable subject matter: a nameless, nondescript diner late at night.The diner is brightly lit from within, lending a whitish glow to the yellow walls and a shine to two large silver coffee urns on the far ledge of a mahogany counter. Three stray customers--a man and woman together and another man sitting across from them with his back to us--are being served by a younger blond man in a white uniform and hat. This scene is at a moderate distance, as if glimpsed while passing by, on the sidewalk perhaps, through the diner's plate-glass window. Above the window is an advertisement for Phillies: ONLY 5ï¿½. AMERICA'S NO. 1 CIGAR. To the left is a section of the sidewalk and street outside the diner, empty of people and cars, of anything but shadows cast from inside the diner and by unseen streetlamps. On the other side of the street, across from the diner, is a two-story redbrick row building, with some windows on the top floor, their blinds partly drawn and impenetrable darkness beyond. On the bottom floor are a couple of storefronts, utterly vacant, as far as we can tell, except for a single ghostly cash register.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The casual if not quite relaxed image of a big-city diner in <i>Nighthawks</i> certainly exemplifies what someone might mean by the term "American scene," as much as would, say, a small-town soda fountain or sandlot baseball game. The painting has a definite sense of place to it, one that depends upon, and even helps to define, an American way of living. But Hopper came to reject the term: "I don't think I ever tried to paint the American scene." This was partly a matter of professional pride. He did not want to be regarded as a distinctly American painter comparable only to other American painters. He wanted to be on level with world art, to be compared with Claude Monet as well as Winslow Homer. But Hopper's feelings also had to do with how he thought about art, his own and in general. As he succinctly put it,"The man is the work." Schools, movements, and groups, like regional identity, were anathema to Hopper, or at least irrelevant. Great art, he felt, was about the individual artist behind the work trying to give his unique, innermost being an objective, communicable form on canvas: "I am trying to paint myself." Thomas Eakins was, Hopper said, "our greatest American painter" not because he provided a facsimile of his surroundings but because he was "a profound personality" who "speaks to us through his art."This notion might be applied to any artist from any nation or period. But it is characteristically American in the sense that Walt Whitman is characteristically American: not because he gave one of his poems the title "Song of Myself" but because all of Whitman's poetry could be gathered under that title. One value American culture continually and predictably holds up--we might even say rigidly conforms to--is the value of nonconformity, of the individual following his or her own heart. The individual is paramount over teachers, over friends, over family, over circumstance: Today we have made popular literary genres out of confessional verse, the memoir, the personal essay, and first-person journalism, in which events being reported occasionally recede in importance before descriptions of the reporter's efforts to report them."Whoso would be a man would be a nonconformist," wrote Emerson back in 1841. This was in "Self-Reliance," one of a series of philosophical essays in which the first-person singular makes a repeated and more than incidental appearance: We cannot even speak of truth as existing apart from the individual who is perceiving that truth. And Emerson's dictate could serve as a motto for "maverick" CEOs who "think outside the box" (and have themselves been publishing a lot of memoirs of late) and trendy pop stars, as well as the willful radicals who jump-startedthe revolution and the Puritans who left everything they knew behind in order to practice their own brand of worship without harassment.This is not to say that Hopper's notion that art expresses the artist's innermost self was facile, only to suggest--his own denials aside--that such an American notion should hardly have kept him from portraying the "American scene." For Hopper, who was too diffident for merely confessional self-exposure, it was quite the opposite; "painting myself" meant painting the external world in accordance with his "personal vision" of it. He felt that abstract painting fatally lacked the artist forging connection between himself and the facts of his environment.To mean something, anything, art must provide a specific sense of where you are and where you have been, of your particular take on the larger history of which you, willingly or not, form a part. Hopper's first title for <i>Skyline Near Washington Square</i> (1925), an unpeopled watercolor of a multistoried building seen from a lower rooftop, was <i>Self-Portrait</i>. Immediately after he complained to an interviewer about having "the American scene pinned on me," he detailed his ancestry: "Like most Americans, I'm an amalgam of many races," but mainly Dutch, specifically "Hudson River Dutch--not Amsterdam Dutch."The artist who painted <i>Nighthawks</i> knew well his pedigree and heritage. And if he was capable of pursuing an emphatically personal vision even at the onset of war, <i>Nighthawks</i> gives ample evidence of the importance he granted to being in a specific place at a specific time. For unlike an image of a sandlot baseball game or small-town soda fountain, which might easily assume an aura of being outside both space and time, of being mythic rather than historical, the urban diner Hopper portrayed is securely rooted in the early 1940s. Diners, for example, were a twentieth-century phenomenon, increasing in numbers throughthe 1920s and 1930s and reaching their heyday in the 1940s and 1950s. The whitish glow within the diner, meanwhile, has the unvarying flatness of fluorescent lights, which had only a year or so previously attained widespread use in stores and restaurants. Advertisements like the advertisement for Phillies cigars, which tops the diner, became ubiquitous in the early decades of the twentieth century. Phillies themselves could be sold for "Only 5 cents" because they were rolled by machine rather than by hand, an innovation that came about in the 1930s, when cigar interests were trying to regain market share from cigarettes, which had been rolled by machine since the mid-1880s.The soft, brimmed, dark-banded hats worn by the diner's male customers--fedoras--were, along with their suits and ties, practically mandated wear for men in midcentury (they were originally worn by women, back in the late nineteenth century). The way that the female customer's tight burgundy shirt exposes the lengths of her arms and her neck down to beneath her collarbone, and how her hair spreads out to her shoulders, reflects the way women were supposed to look in an era that gave rise to such pinup queens as leggy Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth.All of which, while typical, may well have lent itself to a personal vision for an artist for whom such details were remarkable because of who he was and where he had been.2. The ManHopper lived in Manhattan for sixty-odd years--his entire adulthood--in a fourth-story walk-up apartment off Washington Square Park, and <i>Nighthawks</i> is one of many paintings of his that directly reflects life in a big American city in the twentieth century. But he was born on July 22, 1882, in Nyack, NewYork, a small town on the west shore of the Hudson River, twenty-five miles north of Manhattan.He was raised there in a handsome, if relatively plain, two-story clapboard house with a large front porch. Built by his mother's grandfather, the Reverend Joseph W. Griffiths, in 1858, the house was sited on a rise near the river, and from his bedroom window Hopper could watch the ships sail past. In 1856, this same Rev. Griffiths had founded Nyack's Baptist congregation, which the Hoppers attended. Hopper's father, Garret Henry Hopper, a friend of the minister, served as trustee, and Hopper himself attended Sunday school there. Garret Hopper was, for his part, the descendant of Dutch traders who had arrived in America in the mid-seventeenth century; his mother was a zealous Methodist.Hopper's experience of Nyack was as the eldest son in a family that had roots in the town for three generations and in the nation for more than two centuries, lending him a sense of tradition, of being where he belonged, with a deep, rigid faith as central to his identity. Critics would later note an austerity in his painting they would term "Puritan," and there is evidence of sexual and emotional repression in the Hopper household. Hopper's younger sister and only sibling, Marion, would die in 1965, having never married or moved from their house in Nyack. Hopper was self-conscious and reserved (even late in life, renowned and respected, he could sit through entire dinner parties hardly uttering a word) and did not sustain a serious relationship until his early forties. But repression was hardly unusual or frowned upon in their era, and the Hoppers were pr...</p><h2>Author Photo: Portraits, 1983-2002</h2><p>A collection of two hundred of the photographer&#39;s most significant author portraits includes those of such writers as John Irving, Joyce Carol Oates, Truman Capote, Cormac McCarthy, and Gloria Naylor. 20,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Marion Ettlinger</b> has been a photographer since 1968.

"I'll go for help."<br><br>I thought I had seen Dr. Darby in the churchyard not ten minutes earlier, pausing to have a word or two at each stall of the church fï¿½te. But before I could make a move, the Gypsy's dusky hand had covered mine on the black velvet of the tabletop.<br><br>"No," she said. "No . . . don't do that. It happens all the time."<br><br>And she began to cough again.<br><br>I waited it out patiently, almost afraid to move.<br><br>"How old are you?" she said at last. "Ten? Twelve?"<br><br>"Eleven," I said, and she nodded her head wearily as though she'd known it all along.<br><br>"I see--a mountain," she went on, almost strangling on the words, "and the face--of the woman you will become."<br><br>In spite of the stifling heat of the darkened tent, my blood ran cold. She was seeing Harriet, of course!<br><br>Harriet was my mother, who had died in a climbing accident when I was a baby.<br><br>The Gypsy turned my hand over and dug her thumb painfully into the very center of my palm. My fingers spread--and then curled in upon themselves like the toes of a chicken's severed foot.<br><br>She took up my left hand. "This is the hand you were born with," she said, barely glancing at the palm, then letting it fall and picking up the other. ". . . and this is the hand you've grown."<br><br>She stared at it distastefully as the candle flickered. "This broken star on your Mount of Luna shows a brilliant mind turned in upon itself--a mind that wanders the roads of darkness."<br><br>This was not what I wanted to hear.<br><br>"Tell me about the woman you saw on the mountain," I said. "The one I shall become."<br><br>She coughed again, clutching her colored shawl tightly about her shoulders, as though wrapping herself against some ancient and invisible winter wind.<br><br>"Cross my palm with silver," she demanded, sticking out a grubby hand.<br><br>"But I gave you a shilling," I said. "That's what it says on the board outside."<br><br>"Messages from the Third Circle cost extra," she wheezed. "They drain the batteries of my soul."<br><br>I almost laughed out loud. Who did this old hag think she was? But still, she seemed to have spotted Harriet beyond the veil, and I couldn't let skepticism spoil even half a chance of having a few words with my dead mother.<br><br>I dug for my last shilling, and as I pressed the coin into her hand, the Gypsy's dark eyes, suddenly as bright as a jackdaw's, met mine.<br><br>"She is trying to come home," she said. "This . . . woman . . . is trying to come home from the cold. She wants you to help her."<br><br>I leapt to my feet, bashing the bottom of the table with my bare knees.

Father's told you more than once it's disrespectful."<br><br>Feely made a snatch at my ear, but I sidestepped her easily. By sheer necessity, the lightning dodge had become one of my specialties.<br><br>"Where's Daffy?" I asked, hoping to divert her venomous attention.<br><br>Daffy was my other sister, two years older than me, and at thirteen already an accomplished co-torturer.<br><br>"Drooling over the books.

She pointed with her chin to a horseshoe of trestle tables on the churchyard grass, upon which the St. Tancred's Altar Guild and the Women's Institute had joined forces to set up a jumble sale of secondhand books and assorted household rubbish.<br><br>Feely had seemed not to notice the smoking remnants of the Gypsy's tent. As always, she had left her spectacles at home out of vanity, but her inattentiveness might simply have been lack of interest. For all practical purposes, Feely's enthusiasms stopped where her skin ended.<br><br>"Look at these," she said, holding a set of black earrings up to her ears. She couldn't resist showing off. "French jet. They came from Lady Trotter's estate. Glenda says they were quite fortunate to get a tanner for them."<br><br>"Glenda's right," I said. "French jet is nothing but glass."<br><br>It was true: I had recently melted down a ghastly Victorian brooch in my chemical laboratory, and found it to be completely silicaceous. It was unlikely that Feely would ever miss the thing.<br><br>"English jet is so much more interesting," I said. "It's formed from the fossilized remains of monkey-puzzle trees, you see, and--"<br><br>But Feely was already walking away, lured by the sight of Ned Cropper, the ginger-haired potboy at the Thirteen Drakes who, with a certain muscular grace, was energetically tossing wooden batons at the Aunt Sally. His third stick broke the wooden figure's clay pipe clean in two, and Feely pulled up at his side just in time to be handed the teddy bear prize by the madly blushing Ned.<br><br>"Anything worth saving from the bonfire?" I asked Daffy, who had her nose firmly stuck in what, judging by its spotty oxidized pages, might have been a first edition of Pride and Prejudice.<br><br>It seemed unlikely, though. Whole libraries had been turned in for salvage during the war, and nowadays there wasn't much left for the jumble sales. Whatever books remained unsold at the end of the summer season would, on Guy Fawkes Night, be carted from the basement of the parish hall, heaped up on the village green, and put to the torch.<br><br>I tipped my head sideways and took a quick squint at the stack of books Daffy had already set aside: On Sledge and Horseback to Outcast Siberian Lepers, Pliny's Natural History, The Martyrdom of Man, and the first two volumes of the Memoirs of Jacques Casanova--the most awful piffle. Except perhaps for Pliny, who had written some ripping stuff about poisons.<br><br>I walked slowly along the table, running a finger across the books, all of them arranged with their spines upwards: Ethel M.

But it&#x2019;s important to note that the awareness of the need to balance your energy is much more significant than goal-setting or focusing on ultimate desires. And it is from this very important distinction that this work has come forth. As you come to understand and effectively practice the processes offered here, you will not only achieve your goals and desired outcomes more rapidly, but you&#x2019;ll enjoy every single step along the path even before their manifestation. As such, you&#x2019;ll find that the living of your life is an ongoing journey of joy, rather than a series of long dry spells between occasional moments of temporary satisfaction.</p><p>Excited about the clarity and practicality of the translated word from the Beings who call themselves Abraham, Esther and Jerry Hicks began disclosing their amazing Abraham experience to a handful of close business associates in 1986. Recognizing the practical results being received by themselves and by those people who were asking practical questions and then applying Abraham&#x2019;s answers to their own situations, Esther and Jerry made a deliberate decision to allow the teachings of Abraham to become available to an ever-widening circle of seekers of how to live a happier life. Using their San Antonio, Texas, conference center as their base, Jerry and Esther have traveled to approximately 50 cities a year since 1989, presenting interactive Law of Attraction workshops to those leaders who gather to participate in this expanding stream of progressive thought. And although worldwide attention has been given to this philosophy of Well-Being by Leading Edge thinkers and teachers who have, in turn, incorporated many of Abraham&#x2019;s Law of Attraction concepts into their best-selling books, scripts, lectures, and so forth, the primary spread of this material has been from person to person&#x2014;as individuals begin to discover the value of this form of spiritual practicality in their personal life experiences. In November 2011, Jerry made his transition into Non-Physical, and now Esther continues to conduct the Abraham workshops with the help of her physical friends and co-workers and, of course, with the Non-Physical help of Abraham and Jerry. People are able to access Abraham directly by attending the seminars in person or by participating in the online live streaming of most events. There is also an extensive YouTube library of Abraham videos. Abraham&#x2014;a group of uplifting Non-Physical teachers&#x2014;present their Broader Perspective through Esther Hicks. And as they speak to our level of comprehension through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant, yet comprehensively simple essays in print and in sound, they guide us to a clear connection with our loving Inner Being, and to uplifting self-empowerment from our Total Self.

For Christians, this raises some fascinating questions: If there are intelligent beings out there, what would be their relationship to what Christianity claims is a special history on Earth of life with God? Would the fact of persons on other planets banish or modify our understanding of God? Would it reduce the importance of Jesus? What role might goodness and evil play in extraterrestrial civilizations? Might God have incarnated himself among other races of creatures, as he became incarnate as Jesus among us? Respectful of the sciences that disclose the reality of the universe, Thomas O&#39;Meara wonders about good and evil, intelligence and freedom, revelation and life as they might exist in other galaxies. In this book, one possible aspect of the universe we live in meets the perspective of Christian revelation.</p><p>Thomas F. O&#39;Meara, O.P., Warren Professor Emeritus of the University of Notre Dame, is the author of Erich Przywara, S.J.: His Theology and His World (2009) and God in the World: A Guide to Karl Rahner&#39;s Theology (Liturgical Press, 2007).Thomas O&#x2019;Meara is a Catholic theologian of international reputation and exceptional breadth of vision. In <i>Vast Universe,</i> he has produced a study of singular significance on what could at any time emerge as possibly the most important issue that the Catholic Church has ever faced.

Instead, she dresses as a pirate. Although she tries to be fierce and ugly while trick-or-treating, everyone keeps calling her cute. Frustrated, she pelts the elderly Miss Sheldon's porch with pebbles, making a mess. Alison's feelings of guilt ruin her night, but the following day she resolves her troubles. Bauer's accessible narrative is filled with genuine emotions, making the heroine's frustration believable. Spencer's realistic illustrations support the text well. This chapter book is appropriate for children moving to the level beyond beginning readers.?Elisabeth Palmer Abarbanel, Brentwood School, Los Angeles<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.In this third book about Alison (Alison's Wings, 1996, etc.), she and her friend Cindy dress as pirates for Halloween, and are unhappy when no one is frightened by them. When an old woman declares her ``cute,'' Alison's frustration gives way to a foolish act: She throws a handful of pebbles at the woman's door. The next day she confesses and cleans up. This dull entry will convince few emerging readers to go on to Bauer's more challenging works; the plot is a door-to-door description of the trick-or-treat trail, without conveying any of the suspense of Halloween. Those who haven't met Alison previously will have no sense of her character, and the repeated use of the phrase ``fierce and ugly'' becomes a strain.

There was something striking about their physical differences, one tall and well formed, creamy skinned, dark haired, with large golden-brown eyes, the other small and slight, with the pale freckled complexion that so often went with red hair and lively green eyes. <br><br>Meg Barratt paused, slipping her arm out from her companion's, and turned to look across the waters of the Strait of Dover. She rested her folded arms on the wall and lifted her face to the salt spray. The breeze caught her hair, sending red curls flying around her triangular face. She laughed and put a hand to her fashionable straw bonnet.<br><br>"I can smell a storm brewing, Bella," she observed.<br><br>Her companion, who had stopped beside her, sniffed the wind. "It doesn't look like a storm. The sky's blue, the sea's blue, not a cloud in sight."<br><br>"Look over there." Meg pointed towards the horizon. A dark shadow of a bank of cloud was just visible.<br><br>The duchess of St. Jules shook her head with amusement. "You always did fancy yourself as a meteorological expert."<br><br>"It's my country breeding, lassie," Meg returned in a fair approximation of a broad Kentish accent. "And I can also tell when the tide's coming in." <br><br>"Even I can do that," her friend scoffed, peering down at the line of waves creeping up over the sand below the wall. "Besides, you have only to look at the harbor."<br><br>Meg glanced towards Folkestone harbor, where a flotilla of boats were at anchor. The air of urgency was clear even from this distance. Sailors and porters rushed hither and thither, leaping from ship to shore as the boats were readied for an on-tide departure. Some were private yachts, some small merchantmen, and out beyond the harbor bar sat two men-of-war, handsome frigates both of them. <br><br>Her eye was drawn to a sloop-of-war anchored just inside the harbor. The row of guns on her upper deck gleamed in the afternoon sun. Here too there was the impression of haste and preparation. A dinghy drew up alongside the sloop and a man stepped out of the boat and onto the rope ladder dangling down the ship's side. He went up with an agile speed and grace that Meg could only admire and swung himself over the deck rail in one movement. She watched as he climbed to the quarterdeck, a small figure in the distance but somehow, to Meg's imagination, a significant one. <br><br>She shrugged at the fancy and turned away from the wall, preparing to resume the walk. "Where's Jack this afternoon?"<br><br>"At dice with the Prince of Wales," her friend returned succinctly. "Prinny will lose his shirt, of course, but in a classic triumph of hope over experience he sits down at the tables with Jack absolutely convinced that this time his luck will change." She chuckled and linked arms with her friend as they continued their promenade. "I think I've had enough of Folkestone, what do you think, Meg?"<br><br>"I think it's time for me, at least, to return home for a while. My mother's letters begin to sound plaintive," Meg replied. "Poor soul, she tries so hard not to lament my lack of a husband, but she's really in despair. After all this time I've spent with you and Jack in London, and still not even a hint of a suitor." She shook her head in mock dismay. "I'm a lost cause, clearly."<br><br>Arabella shot her a sideways glance. "If you don't mind my saying so, Meg, it's not so much lack of a suitor, it's lack of the right kind," she declared. "You seem to be attracted only to the un-marrying kind."<br><br>Meg gave a heavy sigh, although her green eyes sparkled with mischief. "How right you are, my dear. For some reason I'm only drawn to bad men. They're the only ones who are any fun."<br><br>Arabella grinned. "I can't help but agree with you. Jack's not exactly the epitome of propriety and he wouldn't be so much fun if he were."<br><br>"The baby's had an effect on him, though," Meg observed thoughtfully. "Since little Charles was born he's become much more . . ." She sought for a word. "Not exactly respectable, he's too much of a gamester for that, but considered in his manner."<br><br>Arabella nodded, a slight smile on her lips at the thought of her husband and child. "Talking of Charles, I must get back. I asked the nursemaid to have him ready by four o'clock so that I could take him for an airing in the carriage."<br><br>Meg glanced again towards the horizon. The bank of cloud was closer and the sea beneath its shadow was dark gray and restless. "I don't think you'll go far with him this afternoon."<br><br>Arabella followed her gaze. "Perhaps you're right."<br><br>"You go on home. I want to go to the lending library. Mrs. Carson said she would put aside a copy of Mrs. Radcliff's The Italian for me, but she won't keep it for more than a day."<br><br>"Very well, you take the footman. It's only a step to the house from here, so I'll go home alone."<br><br>"No," Meg said firmly. "A duchess needs a proper escort. I, on the other hand, am quite accustomed to racketing around unaccompanied. Besides, the library's only just up the hill." She gestured towards a narrow lane leading up steeply from The Leas towards the High Street.<br><br>Arabella didn't argue with her. Her friend needed her solitude at times, and in this tiny seaside town no one would object to a woman past the age of discretion taking a walk unescorted. And even if they did, much Meg would care. "I'll see you later then." <br><br>She went off with a farewell wave and Meg turned up the cobbled lane, so narrow that the medieval houses on either side almost formed a roof as they leaned across it and towards each other, casting deep shadow over the damp and slimy cobbles that never felt the sun's warmth.<br><br>Out of the sun the mid-April afternoon had a chill to it, exacerbated by the strengthening wind that now and again whistled down the funnel of the alley. Meg drew her cashmere shawl closer around her and wished she had brought a pelisse. Her lavender cambric gown was the height of fashion but too flimsy to offer protection against the elements.<br><br>She broke into the sunshine again as the lane debouched onto the High Street. The wind was still fresh, though, and she was glad to reach the shelter of the lending library at the top of the street. <br><br>"Good afternoon, madam," the woman at the counter greeted her warmly. "I have Mrs. Radcliff's book for you." She reached down and placed a volume on the counter. "Two other ladies are waiting for it."<br><br>"I'll read it quickly," Meg promised, caressing the book with her fingertips. "If it's anything like The Mysteries of Udolpho, I won't be able to put it down."<br><br>"I think it's even better," the woman said, dropping her voice a little and glancing conspiratorially around the almost deserted library. <br><br>Meg nodded with a smile. "I'll just take a look around, Mrs. Carson, and see if anything else takes my fancy." She wandered off towards the shelves of books lining the rear wall of the library. <br><br>She picked out a copy of William Wordsworth's tragedy The Borderers and as usual became quickly engrossed. It was with a shock that she realized almost an hour had passed. She had no reason to feel guilty, but absurdly she did as she returned to the front of the library. "I didn't realize the time . . . I'll borrow this too, Mrs. Carson." She handed over a shilling.<br><br>"Best hurry home, Miss Barratt," the woman advised, wrapping the books in brown paper. "Looks quite dark out there now."<br><br>Meg glanced towards the bow window. The sun had vanished and it was now as dark as dusk. "There's a storm brewing." She tucked the books wrapped in brown paper under her arm and hurried into the street.<br><br>There were few people about now, and those there were moved quickly, heads down, as they tried to beat the approaching rain. Thunder rumbled. Meg picked up her skirts and walked fast towards the lane that would take her back down to The Leas. Once she reached there the Fortescus' hired house was barely two hundred yards along the seafront. Heavy drops of rain splashed onto the cobbles as she turned into the now dark alley. At least there would be some shelter beneath the overarching roofs of the houses. She looked down the lane and saw a carriage drawn up about halfway along. She frowned. The alley was so narrow there would barely be room for her to squeeze past on either side.<br><br>She paused to tuck the books more securely under her shawl just as another crack of thunder rolled across the sky and the rain began in earnest. It was so heavy it penetrated the lane; surprisingly cold and unsurprisingly wet, it soaked her hat in seconds. There were no sheltering doorways, the houses opened directly onto the street, and resigned to a drenching, Meg set off towards the faint glimmer of the sea at the far end. The rain rushed through the kennel in the middle of the cobbled lane heading down the steep slope for the sea below, and the cobbles themselves quickly became even more slimy with mud and floating refuse. Meg's sandaled foot slipped twice and she grabbed onto the doorframe of a house to regain her balance. The carriage below her still hadn't moved and she wondered what business could possibly cause such a large vehicle to enter such a narrow space. She couldn't see the horses, who were at the front facing the sea, but it would need at least four, and they would be impossible to maneuver.<br><br>She dismissed the puzzle with a brusque head shake and continued more carefully on her way, rain dripping down the back of her neck. Her skirts were soaked, the hem filthy with mud and slime, her sandals were ruined, her shawl bedraggled, her bonnet resembled a mound of wet straw.<br><br>As she approached the carriage the door swung open as if in invitation. Meg frowned and a flicker of apprehension made her heart beat faster. It was ridiculous, of course. There was nothing to be afraid of in this sleepy seaside town, but the open door was barring her from edging past the vehicle. She was still finding it difficult to keep her footing on the steep slippery cobbles and this merely increased her apprehension.<br><br>She approached cautiously, and called out, "Could you close the door please, I need to pass." There was no response. Irritation replaced apprehension. Maybe the rain had drowned out her voice but how could the occupants of the carriage not even think that someone might want to pass? And why the devil were they sitting there with the door open in the middle of a rainstorm? <br><br>She tried to pass the carriage on the other side, resting her hand on the back as she stepped cautiously around. Suddenly the vehicle lurched forward. Her foot slipped and she fell backwards into the rushing water of the kennel. For a split second she realized her danger . . . the water in its headlong flood was going to carry her beneath the carriage down to the sea. And then she realized nothing more.<br>She opened her eyes onto a strange and different world. A pitching, tossing world. She was lying flat on a cot that was more like a box than a bed, but when this world gave a particularly violent heave she saw the point of the wooden sides. It was dark and however hard she stared into the gloom she couldn't manage to make out anything that made any sense. Her head was muzzy and aching and her stomach felt somewhat uncertain. It seemed easiest simply to close her eyes again, so she did.<br><br>When next she awoke it was to a light-filled world of quiet rocking. A voice cackled, "Wake up . . . wake up."<br><br>Gingerly Meg turned her head sideways, aware of a tenderness somewhere at the back of her scalp. A large scarlet bird with very long tail feathers was sitting on a perch regarding her with remarkably bright beady eyes. "Wake up," it repeated and gave a cackle of laughter.<br><br>Meg wondered if she had died and this was some mad afterlife peopled by scarlet talking birds and an eternally rocking foundation. "Do be quiet," she said to the bird, who was still punctuating its repeated instruction with manic laughter. To her astonishment it fell silent.<br><br>Carefully she lifted her head and felt the soreness. There was a lump just behind her right ear. That was reassuring. Bumps belonged to the real world and were inevitable when one fell backwards onto hard cobbles. She'd been drenched and the water from the kennel had been about to carry her in full flood beneath the wheels of the carriage . . .<br><br>The accident had not damaged her memory at least. Every detail of those moments was as clear as daylight. But what had happened afterwards? She lifted the coverlet and peered along her body, clad, astonishingly enough, in an extremely elegant nightgown.<br><br>"G'day . . . g'day . . ." the bird ventured, tilting its head, the beady eye glinting as it watched her.<br><br>"Good day," Meg said, sitting up in the box. An array of windows showed a gently moving sunlit sea. So she was on a boat . . . not too difficult a conclusion. But how, not to mention why? She looked around at the compact paneled space. It was surprisingly comfortable, a carpet that looked to be Aubusson on the floor, cushioned benches beneath the windows, a table and two chairs in the center, securely bolted to the floor, doors that looked like cupboards set into the paneling. And one door that clearly led somewhere.<br><br>A light tap on that door made her heart jump. She swallowed but before she could say anything, the scarlet bird cawed, "Come in . . . come in."<br><br>The door opened and a man stepped inside, closing the door carefully behind him. The bird rose up on the perch and flapped its wings. Instantly Meg's visitor held out his arm and the bird swooped from its perch to the offered wrist like a falcon returning to his jesses.<br><br>Meg stared at him. "Who the devil are you?" she demanded.<br><br>Her visitor's slight smile was a gleaming white flash in a deeply tanned face. He leaned his shoulders against the door and regarded her with an amiable curiosity. "Oddly enough, I was about to ask you exactly the same question."</p><h2>Blacktail Trophy Tactics II</h2><p>A resource library of hunting tecniques, knowledge, and insight which apply to the pursuit of all big game animals. <p>The culmination of two years of work in ranalyzing, reworking and adding to this author's first book, "Blacktail Trophy Tactics". </p><p>This book will make you think and in some cases rethink your ideas on hunting tactics.</p></p><p>Boyd Iverson is from Eugene, Oregon and has successfully hunted blacktail deer for over 30 years.

The V.A.

He now lives in the Pacific Northwest&#x2014;the author, not Tom!&#x2014;where his time is divided between writing and being a lazy retired guy. While he hopes that both old and new readers will enjoy the stories, he offers a word of caution: The innocence and naivetï¿½ of the original Tom Jr, along with some of the lesser characters, do not appear in these books. Some have been replaced by "stronger" individuals. There are a few people with similar names but this series is not just an add-on to the 1954-1971 books. It takes place in the near future to today that sees our hero more involved in issues concerning all of mankind rather than just building stuff. They are still meant to be enjoyed by readers as young as 8-9 who possess good reading skills, and can be enjoyed by people the author&#x2019;s own age bracket, that being below, at or above the 60-year mark.

From the elimination of school prayer to the eradication of the story of Christianity from history textbooks, this persuasive book shows that our social engineers inculcate hostility toward this religion and its values in the name of "diversity," "tolerance," and "multiculturalism."<br><br>Through court cases, case studies, and true stories, Limbaugh details the widespread assault on the religious liberties of Christians in America today and urges believers to fight back in order to restore their First Amendment right of religious freedom.</p><p>David Limbaugh is a lawyer, nationally syndictated columnist with Creators Syndicate, political commentator, and author of nine national bestsellers, including <i>Crimes Against Liberty</i>, <i>The Great Destroyer</i>, <i>Jesus on Trial</i>, and <i>Jesus is Risen</i>. The brother of radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, he lives in Cape Giradeau, Missouri. Follow him on Twitter: @DavidLimbaugh.The point of view is that persecution of Christians in the media and public life is not recognized with the same consistency it is when other groups--such as minorities and gays--are similarly persecuted or criticized. The articulate author says that attacks on Christian expression, often framed as a concern about separation of church and state, have gone too far in removing God from our educational institutions. Since many kinds of controversial expression are being suppressed these days, the essay is a welcome effort to open up the marketplace of ideas we call public discourse. Though provocative and even captivating, the arguments still fall short of the sound and nuanced discussion this topic deserves. The audio also would have been helped by a professional speaker.

Instead, we live with a vague sense of discontent as we question who we are and what God has designed us to do. Vocational coach Deborah Koehn Loyd believes that every person has a voice that must be heard and expressed through vocation. She walks you through a transformational journey of creating your own vocational credo so that you can be a world-changer in the way God has intended. You?ll discover: <ul><li>the true meaning of vocation</li><li>how to redeem past pains in your life</li><li>your personal vocational preferences</li><li>a unique plan for your life?s work</li></ul> Using unique tools and practical guidance combined with inspiring stories of personal transformation, this workbook will provide you with the resources to find your credo and accomplish the work God has designed just for you.</p><p>Deborah Loyd is a teacher, pastor and church planter. She serves as an adjunct faculty member at George Fox University and Warner Pacific College and is cofounder of The Bridge Church in Portland, Oregon. She lives in Portland with her husband, Ken, and three children."How do we make sense of our stories&#x2015;that odd collection of puzzles and pain, risks and dreams, gifts and passions that make up our lives? In <em>Your Vocational Credo</em>, Dr. Loyd leads readers through a series of questions to craft their own vocational credos. Readers will not only be able to articulate their own <em>why</em>, but also <em>who</em> on earth they are here for. This book is a sure guide to anyone wanting to live with meaning." (Loren Kerns, associate dean, director, doctor of ministry program, George Fox Evangelical Seminary)<br><br>"Too often a cacophony of voices tempt us to wander directionless toward no real purpose. Deborah Loyd cuts through the chatter and offers practical, sage and brilliant guidance. She is the person I trust to mentor others to discover their true voice and authentic vocation&#x2015;the 'why' of our lives. This is an indispensable resource for leading others, and more importantly, finding our own way forward." (Trey Doty, executive director, Responder Life)<br><br>"Hidden within the long unfolding story of our pain, passions, signature moments and longings lies a unique song that only you are meant to sing. This sagely writer can help you leave behind the mediocrity of a meandering, unexamined life and discover your God-given voice and the lyrics that are uniquely yours for the good of the world." (Daniel Steigerwald, coach, church planter, trainer, educator, writer)<br><br>"I know of no other person who is more qualified to write a genuinely transformational book on vocation than Deborah Loyd. Through her work of contextualizing the gospel for younger generations, she understands how to teach and translate God's wisdom in such ways that lives are deeply changed and souls are given hope. I anticipate that <em>Your Vocational Credo</em> will become a classic in its field." (Christine Wood, author, educator, founder of the EPIC Leadership Center)<br><br>"It's a joy to see a book written about how we can love the Lord our God with all our vocation. Wouldn't it be amazing if we could grasp that our vocations are holy, sacred and just as important as pastoring or work at a church? Deborah is just the right person to be writing on this&#x2015;she doesn't write from theory but from living it out. <em>Your Vocational Credo</em> can reshape how we spend the majority of our time, from something routine and predictable into something purposeful and missional." (Dan Kimball, pastor, Vintage Faith Church, author, They Like Jesus but Not the Church)<br><br>"Deborah Loyd is a genuinely remarkable woman. As such, she is perfectly suited to talk artfully about the destiny-shaping pursuit of finding one's personal calling and integrating it into life. This book brings needed compassion, color and depth to the serious process of vocational clarity." (Alan Hirsch, author and activist, alanhirsch.org)<br><br>"In a world and church where many men and women of all ages and experiences settle for less and go through the motions of a job or ministry and doubt their passions and gifts, we are in desperate need of guides, mentors and encouragers who will help us get unstuck and find our way forward to live out who God made us to be. Dr. Deborah Koehn Loyd is exactly the right companion and catalyst for this journey. Packed with wisdom, real stories, biblical grounding and practical exercises, <em>Your Vocational Credo</em> is a much-needed tool for individuals, groups, churches and organizations. I know it will call many to life." (Kathy Escobar, co-pastor of The Refuge, spiritual director and author of Faith Shift)<br><br>"What I love about Deb Loyd's book: First, it can be read and used well by people of all ages, in all walks of life, who are willing to stretch to find their true selves. Second, while beautifully poetic in its language and form, it is also amazingly practical and down to earth. By the time you've read it, you know exactly what to do to effect the changes in your life that will bring you to a new phase of existence. My favorite quote in the book: 'God desires to repurpose us from being outwardly powerful to inwardly powerful.' As an older woman looking for a way to live the last decades of my life following Jesus even closer, this book is a must-read, and that quote is now up on my bathroom mirror!" (Rita Warren, board chair, Christian Associates International)<br><br>"Do not be fooled by assuming this is an ordinary how-to book. Dr. Deborah Loyd offers a useful roadmap with some how-tos as a guide, but her point of reference is nothing close to ordinary. A woman whose leadership and mentoring is marked by sacrificial risk, by beating the odds, by plumbing personal pain, by giving up possessions and position&#x2015;in order to honest-to-goodness walk with young people on the margins of society&#x2015;has a voice that you won't want to miss. She continues to lead change as she shares her hard-won wisdom with those of us who may not be as likely to give all that she has, in order that we might be called more deeply into our own vocation and voice. This is the kind of authentic leadership the world needs. I am delighted to recommend the work of a dear friend, respected mentor, and visionary thinker and action-taker." (Kelly Bean, author of How to Be a Christian Without Going to Church, kelly-bean.com)<br><br>"Deborah's voice is pure as she woos the reader into a place of vulnerability, allowing discovery of what one is all about and how distinctiveness is the key to unlocking meaningful work. This book addresses important shifts in culture as a generation seeks to rediscover vocation and calling rather than letting work be a means to an end. The reader should be warned, a vocational credo will upset the status quo and ignite personal transformation." (Kirk L. Wayman, business and leadership consultant, Wayman Consulting, associate pastor, Redding First Church of the Nazarene)</p><h2>A Universal History of Iniquity</h2><p>Borges first collection of stories (1935) in his writing, borges always combined high seriousness with a wicked sense of fun here he reveals his delight in re-creating (or making up) colorful stories from the orient, the islamic world, and the wild west, as well as his horrified fascination with knife fights, political and personal betrayal, and bloodthirsty revenge spark-ling with the sheer exuberant pleasure of story-telling, this collection marked the emergence of an utterly distinctive literary voice</p><p>JORGE LUIS BORGES (1899-1986) now has in print with Modern Classics the short story collections THE ALEPH, FICTIONS, BRODIE&#39;S REPORT, A UNIVERSAL HISTORY OF INFAMY and THE BOOK OF IMAGINARY BEINGS.

Courageous, bold, honest. Brian (husband): After nearly two decades of marriage to a sexy, loving woman - with whom I made love almost every night - I came home from work one evening and told her I was moving out, leaving her for another woman. Lucky for me, my wife refused to give up on our marriage. We are now closer and more committed than ever. What you&#39;re probably wondering is, if I loved my wife so much, why did I do it? In this book, I have answered that question. Danielle (teenage daughter): When my father told me he was leaving my mother for another woman, I felt it was me he was abandoning. I wondered &#34;what has my whole life been so far, a joke&#34; In this book, I share the truth about my feelings Anne (wife): My Husband&#39;s affair became the best thing that ever happened to me, yes eventually, but it was also the most devastating of my life. There was a time when I wondered if I could even live through it. What people are saying.&#34;Riveting . . . Mesmerizing . . . I couldn&#39;t put the book down&#34; &#34;My Husband&#39;s Affair&#34; deliberately removes itself from providing &#34;the theoretical and psychological&#34; explanations for the why of infidelity and instead purposes to take readers on a gut-honest, courageous, straight-from-the-heart journey into the lives of a couple/family who endured the aftermath of an affair. A must-read before couples, facing infidelity, make life decisions they may later regret. This book provides an alternative to the expected . . . hope that it&#39;s not over. Don Huston, BTh, MC, RCC, Couples Therapist This book makes a wonderful contribution to the growing willingness of couples to &#34;break the code of silence&#34; and share their experience with affairs in order to help others. It offers clear insight into the pain involved as well as great hope for the power to recove</p><p>Born in Northern England, raised between Chicago, Illinois and Copenhagen, Denmark, Anne Bercht is a well-traveled, dynamic and courageous woman.

This step by step course is designed for elementary school-aged children (ages 5-11) and quickly teaches the student to play songs they will know and love. These lessons start by playing with just the right hand and gradually build to adding the left hand thumb and learning how to play with both hands. Song arrangements were carefully selected to provide an easy transition from learning the basics to covering more interesting rhythms, techniques, and musical ideas. The book features standard music notation for each song and exercise along with fingering notation and hand shifts to make the course easier to learn. This method includes online access to over an hour of video instruction that will help the child play with proper form and timing. The video shows the piano, both hands, and the sheet music on-screen at the same time. The audio tracks allow the student to practice and play along with easy songs at two speeds. The slower speed features just the piano playing the song. The faster version includes vocals and other instruments in a performance-like setting. The combination of book, video, and audio make this the easiest to understand piano course for kids available.Songlist: Mary Had a Little Lamb, Ode to Joy, Hot Cross Buns, Jingle Bells, Oh When the Saints, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Rain Rain Go Away, This Old Man, Hush Little Baby, I Have a Little Dreidel, Frere Jacques, Alouette, Yankee Doodle- Watch &amp; Learn, Inc.</p><p></p><h2>Love, Mom and Me: Simple Ways to Stay Connected: A Guided Mother and Daughter Journal</h2><p><p><strong>A one-of-a-kind journal for the mother &amp; daughter who crave a rule-free, creative way to connect with each other. </strong></p><p>This engaging prompt journal is the perfect tool to build mother-daughter relationships.

The story is written from the perspective of the child whose #imagination runs wild with fantasy during father/son time.

Ferguson works full time as a Marketing Manager in New York, NY and is an accomplished wedding photographer. He likes to also consider himself as an accomplished chef, fitness model, and DJ, but there is really no evidence to support these claims. He attended the State University of New York at Albany where he studied marketing and management and somehow managed to graduate with honors. Although originally from Brooklyn, New York, he now lives in Maplewood, New Jersey (wife&#39;s decision) with his wife, their two children, and their very non-destructive cat.&#34;Daddy&#39;s Arms,&#34; is a fun and imaginative story of a young boy&#39;s adventurous interactions with his dad. The story is written from the perspective of the child whose #imagination runs wild with fantasy during father/son time. Whether it s playtime, bath time, or bedtime, each moment the two spend together becomes a new, colorful, exciting adventure. Reviewed By Kristy Vee for Readers&#39; Favorite &#34;Daddy&#39;s Arms by Fabian E. Ferguson is a children&#39;s rhyming book about the loving bond between a young boy and his doting, playful father. The story is written from the perspective of the child whose imagination runs wild with fantasy during father/son time. Whether it&#39;s playtime, bath time, or bedtime, each moment the two spend together becomes a new, colorful, exciting adventure. No matter where he&#39;s at -- pretend climbing a mountain, in an airplane, elevator, or hurling through space -- one thing is for sure, there&#39;s no safer place than his favorite place...in daddy&#39;s arms. Daddy&#39;s Arms is such an adorably sweet story about the bond between father and son that it simply melts your heart and brings a smile to your face. The safety and coziness of a father&#39;s embrace is so special, and Fabian E. Ferguson does an excellent job at capturing and expressing those feelings straight from the heart of a child. I love to see books out there devoted to the importance of the relationship between father and son, as there seems to be a shortage of positive books celebrating fatherhood. It&#39;s great how the author intertwined their activities with the fantasy aspect, reminding us that if children are given the safety of a parent&#39;s loving presence, their imaginations are free to roam. The illustrations are colorful and detailed, and the rhyming adds an extra bit of fun to a well thought out, lovely book that&#39;s sure to be a hit with children and parents alike. Well deserving of five stars! --Kristy Vee for Readers&#39; Favorite</p><h2>How to Eat Fried Worms (Scholastic Gold)</h2><p><b>Thomas Rockwell's deliciously disgusting and enduring classic joins the Scholastic Gold line, now with exclusive bonus materials!</b><br><br>Billy isn't one to back down from a bet.<br><br>But this one is <i>gross</i>: If he eats fifteen worms in fifteen days, Alan will pay him fifty dollars.

Among the titles are <em>Peter&#x2019;s Dream</em>, <em>I Don&#x2019;t Like Peas</em>, and <em>The New Bike</em> (the latter two published under the pen name Marie Vinje), the <em>Get Ready for Preschool</em>, <em>Kindergarten</em>, and<em> First Grade </em>workbook trio, along with the entire Get Ready, Little Thinker, I Know It!, Try-n-Spy, and Little Busy Book workbook series.</p> <p>She is also co-founder, along with her late husband James Hoffman, Ph.D., of School Zone Publishing. Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents. Her husband lent his blended talents of educator and entrepreneur. A professor of education who also had first-hand experience as an elementary teacher, he was involved in teacher education programs at several colleges and had served at the helm of a company that published classroom materials.</p> <p>Combining rock-solid editorial judgment and creative instincts with a thorough understanding of early education, Joan Hoffman was an exemplary proponent of design thinking long before it became a conceptual label. An innovative problem-solver, she has always sought to reach out to end users and challenge convention. Separating fleeting trends from legitimate advances has been essential to her company&#x2019;s longevity.</p> <p>The results speak for themselves. With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms. The company received Apple&#x2019;s exclusive Human Interface Design Excellence Award for software development, and its apps were part of the first-generation iPad launch in 2010. School Zone&#x2019;s flagship product, the Little Scholar Learning Tablet, has earned industry-wide recognition and awards, as has its online learning destination Anywhere Teacher. Inspired by mom&#x2019;s story-telling excellence, son Jonathan continued that legacy with Charlie &amp; Company, an original series for ages 3-7, available on Oznnoz, Kidoodle.tv, ToonGoggles, BatteryPop, Ameba, and Highbrow.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman says, &#x201c;It is incredibly rewarding to see the children and grandchildren of some of our original customers enjoying our ever-evolving books, apps, flash cards, games, music, and other products&#x2014;both print and digital.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In 2019 School Zone celebrates its 40th anniversary, spanning portions of five decades and having sold more than 370 million educational products.

Drawing on more than two decades of experience as a therapist specializing in women&#x2019;s health and hundreds of interviews with suffering daughters, Dr. Karyl McBride helps you recognize the widespread effects of this emotional abuse and create an individualized program for self-protection, resolution, and complete recovery. <br> <br>Narcissistic mothers teach their daughters that love is not unconditional, that it is given only when they behave in accordance with maternal expectations and whims.

I had been left home by the family with the admonition to take care of the house until they returned. That&#x2019;s something they always say to me when they go out: &#x201c;Take care of the house, Harold. You&#x2019;re the watchdog.&#x201d; I think it&#x2019;s their way of making up for not taking me with them. As if I wanted to go anyway. You can&#x2019;t lie down at the movies and still see the screen. And people think you&#x2019;re being impolite if you fall asleep and start to snore, or scratch yourself in public. No thank you, I&#x2019;d rather be stretched out on my favorite rug in front of a nice, whistling radiator.<br> <br>But I digress. I was talking about that first night. Well, it was cold, the rain was pelting the windows, the wind was howling, and it felt pretty good to be indoors. I was lying on the rug with my head on my paws just staring absently at the front door. My friend Chester was curled up on the brown velvet armchair, which years ago he&#x2019;d staked out as his own. I saw that once again he&#x2019;d covered the whole seat with his cat hair, and I chuckled to myself, picturing the scene tomorrow. (Next to grasshoppers, there is nothing that frightens Chester more than the vacuum cleaner.)<br> <br>In the midst of this reverie, I heard a car pull into the driveway. I didn&#x2019;t even bother to get up and see who it was. I knew it had to be my family&#x2014;the Monroes&#x2014;since it was just about time for the movie to be over. After a moment, the front door flew open. There they stood in the doorway: Toby and Pete and Mom and Dad Monroe. There was a flash of lightning, and in its glare I noticed that Mr. Monroe was carrying a little bundle&#x2014;a bundle with tiny glistening eyes.<br> <br>Pete and Toby bounded into the room, both talking at the top of their lungs. Toby shouted, &#x201c;Put him over here, Dad.&#x201d;</p><h2>Interrupting Chicken</h2><p><b>&#x201c;The delivery is Catskill perfect; readers will fall hard for the antics of this hapless pair.&#x201d; &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i>&nbsp;(starred review)</b><br><br>It&#x2019;s time for the little red chicken&#x2019;s bedtime story &#x2014; and a reminder from Papa to try not to interrupt. But the chicken can&#x2019;t help herself! Whether the tale is Hansel and Gretel or&nbsp;<i>Little Red Riding Hood</i>&nbsp;or even&nbsp;<i>Chicken Little</i>, she jumps into the story to save its hapless characters. Now it&#x2019;s the little red chicken&#x2019;s turn to tell a story, but will her yawning papa make it to the end without his own kind of interrupting? The charming 2011 Caldecott Honor Book is available in paperback for the first time.</p><p><b>&nbsp;</b>PreSchool-Grade 2 In a picture book that is as charming and comic as <i>Pouch!</i> (Putnam, 2009), Stein again represents an affectionate parent's trials with a vigorous child. At bedtime, despite a rooster papa's best efforts to share classic fairy tales with his daughter, Little Red Chicken's soft heart means she can't help but jump into each story to warn Hansel and Gretel and then Red Riding Hood about impending danger, and to assure Chicken Little: Don't panic! It was just an acorn. In each case, the story abruptly ends, wearying the father with what to do next. When he convinces his daughter to compose her own story, she fills four pages with preschool-style spelling and drawings about a chicken putting her papa to bed, but her tale is interrupted by Papa's snores. At the end, the pair cuddle together, asleep. Stein's droll cartoons use watercolor, crayon, china marker, pen, and tea. The rich colors of the characters perfectly contrast with the sepia pages of the storybooks. This is one of the rare titles that will entertain both parent and child. <i>Gay Lynn Van Vleck, Henrico County Library, Glen Allen, VA</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The mouse is good enough to eat but smart enough to know this, so he invents . . . the gruffalo! As Mouse explains, the gruffalo is a creature with terrible claws, and terrible tusks in its terrible jaws, and knobbly knees and turned-out toes, and a poisonous wart at the end of its nose. But Mouse has no worry to show. After all, there&#x2019;s no such thing as a gruffalo. . . .</p><p><b>Julia Donaldson</b> lives in Glasgow, Scotland.The eponymous character introduced by this British team owes a large debt to Maurice Sendak's Where the Wild Things Are. When Mouse meets Fox in the "deep dark wood," he invents a story about the gruffalo, described very much like Sendak's fearsome quartet of wild thingsA"He has terrible tusks, and terrible claws, and terrible teeth in his terrible jaws." The gullible fox runs away when Mouse tells him that the gruffalo's favorite food is roasted fox. "Silly old Fox!" says Mouse, "Doesn't he know?/ There's no such thing as a gruffalo!" Owl and Snake follow suit until, with a turn of the page, Mouse runs into the creature he has imagined. Quick-thinking Mouse then tells the monster, "I'm the scariest creature in this deep dark wood./ Just walk behind me and soon you'll see,/ Everyone for miles is afraid of me." Fox, Owl and Snake appear to be terrified of the tiny mouse, but readers can plainly see the real object of their fears. By story's end, the gruffalo flees, and Mouse enjoys his nut lunch in peace. Despite the derivative plot line, debut author Donaldson manipulates the repetitive language and rhymes to good advantage, supplying her story with plenty of scary-but-not-too-scary moments. Scheffler's gruffalo may seem a goofy hybrid of Max's wild things, but his cartoonlike illustrations build suspense via spot-art previews of the monster's orange eyes, black tongue and purple prickles until the monster's appearance in full.

Great learning at home and in the classroom.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman, M.A., is the author and co-author of hundreds popular storybooks and workbooks for children. Among the titles are <em>Peter&#x2019;s Dream</em>, <em>I Don&#x2019;t Like Peas</em>, and <em>The New Bike</em> (the latter two published under the pen name Marie Vinje), the <em>Get Ready for Preschool</em>, <em>Kindergarten</em>, and<em> First Grade </em>workbook trio, along with the entire Get Ready, Little Thinker, I Know It!, Try-n-Spy, and Little Busy Book workbook series.</p> <p>She is also co-founder, along with her late husband James Hoffman, Ph.D., of School Zone Publishing. Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents. Her husband lent his blended talents of educator and entrepreneur. A professor of education who also had first-hand experience as an elementary teacher, he was involved in teacher education programs at several colleges and had served at the helm of a company that published classroom materials.</p> <p>Combining rock-solid editorial judgment and creative instincts with a thorough understanding of early education, Joan Hoffman was an exemplary proponent of design thinking long before it became a conceptual label. An innovative problem-solver, she has always sought to reach out to end users and challenge convention. Separating fleeting trends from legitimate advances has been essential to her company&#x2019;s longevity.</p> <p>The results speak for themselves. With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms. The company received Apple&#x2019;s exclusive Human Interface Design Excellence Award for software development, and its apps were part of the first-generation iPad launch in 2010. School Zone&#x2019;s flagship product, the Little Scholar Learning Tablet, has earned industry-wide recognition and awards, as has its online learning destination Anywhere Teacher. Inspired by mom&#x2019;s story-telling excellence, son Jonathan continued that legacy with Charlie &amp; Company, an original series for ages 3-7, available on Oznnoz, Kidoodle.tv, ToonGoggles, BatteryPop, Ameba, and Highbrow.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman says, &#x201c;It is incredibly rewarding to see the children and grandchildren of some of our original customers enjoying our ever-evolving books, apps, flash cards, games, music, and other products&#x2014;both print and digital.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In 2019 School Zone celebrates its 40th anniversary, spanning portions of five decades and having sold more than 370 million educational products. Hoffman continues to be hands-on in the company, still writing, still envisioning, and still putting kids, parents, and teachers first.</p>Recently, I had the opportunity to try out some of the learning workbooks from School Zone. While I had previously purchased a handful of different books for my children, these books are by far the best I've seen yet. Normally, we'll do about two pages per day but "workbook time" has become a dreaded part of the day... until now. School Zone sent my little ones and me a sampling of their products and, thus far, we absolutely love them! --Eighty MPH Mom<br><br>Bought it for goody gift bags for my son' class and instantly was a big hit among children! It's useful and educational too. My 5 yr old son and 3 yr old daughter loved it and finished the exercises in couple of days and wanted more similar books! I loved that they spend more time on books than TV and this book kept their attention and interest throughout which is the most wanted and desired. Strongly recommend. --Amazon<br><br>My four year old son loves finding the hidden pictures in this book! I highly recommend, especially for preschool age children. I will almost certainly be purchasing again in the future. This is an excellent product, especially for the price!

Zack is now the owner of Ball &amp;&nbsp;Chain, a historic live-music venue on Miami's&nbsp;famed Calle Ocho, in the heart of Little Havana.

In Italian artist De Lauretis&#x2019;s grainy compositions, the father&#x2019;s balloon-shaped bulk lies in comical contrast to the tininess of the infant (a ginger like his dad). The father bottle-feeds the boy, tickles his feet and tummy, and bathes him.

The company continually updates materials with new features and content, reflective of changing standards, evolving teaching methods, and overall best practices. The result? Great learning at home and in the classroom.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman, M.A., is the author and co-author of hundreds popular storybooks and workbooks for children. Among the titles are <em>Peter&#x2019;s Dream</em>, <em>I Don&#x2019;t Like Peas</em>, and <em>The New Bike</em> (the latter two published under the pen name Marie Vinje), the <em>Get Ready for Preschool</em>, <em>Kindergarten</em>, and<em> First Grade </em>workbook trio, along with the entire Get Ready, Little Thinker, I Know It!, Try-n-Spy, and Little Busy Book workbook series.</p> <p>She is also co-founder, along with her late husband James Hoffman, Ph.D., of School Zone Publishing. Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents. Her husband lent his blended talents of educator and entrepreneur. A professor of education who also had first-hand experience as an elementary teacher, he was involved in teacher education programs at several colleges and had served at the helm of a company that published classroom materials.</p> <p>Combining rock-solid editorial judgment and creative instincts with a thorough understanding of early education, Joan Hoffman was an exemplary proponent of design thinking long before it became a conceptual label. An innovative problem-solver, she has always sought to reach out to end users and challenge convention. Separating fleeting trends from legitimate advances has been essential to her company&#x2019;s longevity.</p> <p>The results speak for themselves. With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms. The company received Apple&#x2019;s exclusive Human Interface Design Excellence Award for software development, and its apps were part of the first-generation iPad launch in 2010. School Zone&#x2019;s flagship product, the Little Scholar Learning Tablet, has earned industry-wide recognition and awards, as has its online learning destination Anywhere Teacher. Inspired by mom&#x2019;s story-telling excellence, son Jonathan continued that legacy with Charlie &amp; Company, an original series for ages 3-7, available on Oznnoz, Kidoodle.tv, ToonGoggles, BatteryPop, Ameba, and Highbrow.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman says, &#x201c;It is incredibly rewarding to see the children and grandchildren of some of our original customers enjoying our ever-evolving books, apps, flash cards, games, music, and other products&#x2014;both print and digital.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In 2019 School Zone celebrates its 40th anniversary, spanning portions of five decades and having sold more than 370 million educational products. Hoffman continues to be hands-on in the company, still writing, still envisioning, and still putting kids, parents, and teachers first.</p>great book <br>Good work book pages for kids....my daughter likes to just play school....but we also did homeschooling with some help from these and she is surpassing every one in school now.

Now packaged as a board book with a new plush doll, this classic book will continue to introduce new generations of children to the magical world of Eric Carle.</p><p>"In the light of the moon a little egg lay on a leaf." So begins Eric Carle's modern classic, <em>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em>. More than 12 million copies of this book have been sold in its original, full-sized edition, and the beloved tale of science and gluttony has been translated into 20 languages. This five-by-four-inch miniature edition is truly tiny, with tiny type, but it is a nice size for small hands to hold and flip through the pictures. Despite its diminished state, the book is complete in every detail, following the ravenous caterpillar's path as he eats his way through one apple (and the pages of the book itself) on Monday, two pears on Tuesday, three plums on Wednesday, and so on, through cherry pie and sausage--until he is really fat and has a stomachache. And no doubt you know what happens next! Kids love butterfly metamorphosis stories, and this popular favorite teaches counting and the days of the week, too. A fun gift package for caterpillar fans. (Baby to preschool) <em>--Karin Snelson</em> <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle and Tomie dePaola: Author One-on-One</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle</strong> is the creator, author, and illustrator of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> and many other children&#x2019;s books. <strong>Tomie dePaola</strong> is the author and illustrator of <i>Strega Nona: Her Story</i> and countless other books. They recently had a conversation about their careers as picture book authors. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> When I was only four years old, I announced to my family in particular and to the world in general that I was going to become an artist, and write stories and draw pictures for books. I never swayed from that early declaration. I&#x2019;ve always been curious to know, what inspired you to become a creator and illustrator of picture books? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My career began as a graphic designer and for a number of years I worked as an art director for an advertising agency in New York. In the mid 1960's Bill Martin, Jr. saw an ad of a red lobster that I had designed and asked me to illustrate his <i>Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?</i> Well, I was set on fire! I was so inspired by this book, and the opportunity to illustrate it changed my life. After that, I started to create my own books, both words and pictures, and really it was then that I had found my true course in life. <br> <br> Now, I have a question for you, Tomie. How would you describe your artistic style, and has it changed over time? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> My illustration style is heavily influenced by folk art--strong simple shapes, bold lines, color, color, color and a deceptive simplicity. My style began to develop early in art school, and through the years, it hasn&#x2019;t changed very much, but it has refined itself. How would you describe yours? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> My aim with my work is to simplify and refine, be logical and harmonious. I like to use simple shapes, bright colors and a lot of white space. I write for the child inside of me. That is always where I begin. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> I do, as well. The only audience I keep in mind is that four-year-old in me. People sometimes ask me what advice I would give to young artists. I always think of the wonderful advice I received from my twin cousins when they were in art school in the late '30s. They told me, &#x201c;Practice, practice, practice and don&#x2019;t copy.&#x201d; <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> I often tell people about the four magic letters: DO IT. I want to be encouraging but I can only offer the example of my own experience, which is just one approach. There are many wonderful artists to learn about, which is important. But you must use your own imagination. You have to just do it. <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> How do you feel knowing that a copy of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> is sold every 30 seconds, somewhere in the world? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> It is hard for me, maybe for others too, to grasp this concept. But I am truly honored that my story is enjoyed by so many and that it is now being shared by a generation of parents who grew up with my book. How about your <i>Strega Nona</i>. She is one of your most popular characters. Can you share how she came to be? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> In the &#x2018;70s when I was teaching at a college, we were required to attend faculty meetings. I always sat in the back with a yellow legal pad. Everyone thought I was taking notes. At one meeting a doodle appeared of a little lady with a big nose and a big chin. I named her Strega Nona, and the rest is history. Speaking of history, how will you be celebrating the third annual <i>Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day this year? <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle:</strong> On <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> Day, March 20th, I will probably be at home with my wife, Bobbie (I am a bit of a hermit, actually). But I will be saying a little toast to the caterpillar for whom I have a special place in my heart. And speaking of holidays, isn&#x2019;t your favorite holiday Christmas. Do you have a special Christmas memory? <br> <br> <strong>Tomie dePaola:</strong> Christmas is my favorite holiday. My favorite Christmas was the one when I received tons and tons of art supplies: everything from an easel to paints, pads and pads of paper, and &#x201c;how to draw&#x201d; books. <br> <strong>A Look Inside <em><em>The Very Hungry Caterpillar (Board Book)</em></em></strong> <em> <br> <strong>(Click on Images to Enlarge)</strong> <br> </em> <p></p> <p> </p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <p> </p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p><strong>Eric Carle and Tomie dePaola: Author One-on-One</strong> <br> <br> <strong>Eric Carle</strong> is the creator, author, and illustrator of <i>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</i> and many other children&#x2019;s books. <strong>Tomie dePaola</strong> is the author and illustrator of <i>Strega Nona: Her Story</i> and countless other books.

Before joining Google Ventures, Braden led design for several Google products, including Gmail, Google Apps for Business, Google Spreadsheets, and Google Trends.Sprint 1<p></p> Challenge<p></p> <br>In 2002, a clarinet player named James Freeman quit his job as a professional musician and founded&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a coffee cart.<br> <br>James was obsessed with freshly roasted coffee. In those days in the San Francisco area, it was nearly impossible to find coffee beans with a roast date printed on the bag. So James decided to do it himself. He carefully roasted beans in a potting shed at home, then drove to farmers&#x2019; markets in Berkeley and Oakland, California, where he brewed and sold coffee by the cup. His manner was polite and accommodating, and the coffee was delicious.<br> <br>Soon James and his cart, called Blue Bottle Coffee, developed a following. In 2005, he established a permanent Blue Bottle location in a friend&#x2019;s San Francisco garage. Over the next few years, as the business grew, he slowly opened more cafï¿½s. By 2012, Blue Bottle had locations in San Francisco, Oakland, Manhattan, and Brooklyn. It was a business that many would have considered perfect. The coffee was ranked among the best nationwide. The baristas were friendly and knowledgeable. Even the interior design of the cafï¿½s was perfect: wooden shelves, tasteful ceramic tiles, and an understated logo in the perfect shade of sky blue.<br> <br>But James didn&#x2019;t consider the business perfect, or complete. He was still just as passionate about coffee and hospitality, and he wanted to bring the Blue Bottle experience to even more coffee lovers. He wanted to open more cafï¿½s. He wanted to deliver freshly roasted coffee to people&#x2019;s homes, even if they didn&#x2019;t live anywhere near a Blue Bottle location. If that coffee cart had been Sputnik, the next phase would be more like a moon shot.<br> <br>So in October 2012, Blue Bottle Coffee raised $20 million from a group of Silicon Valley investors, including GV. James had many plans for that money, but one of the most obvious was building a better online store for selling fresh coffee beans. But Blue Bottle wasn&#x2019;t a tech company and James was no expert at online retail. How could he translate the magic of his cafï¿½s to smartphones and laptops?<br> <br>Several weeks later, on a bright December afternoon, Braden Kowitz and John Zeratsky met up with James. They sat around a counter, drank coffee, and discussed the challenge. The online store was important to the company. It would take time and money to get it right, and it was difficult to know where to start. In other words, it sounded like a perfect candidate for a sprint. James agreed.<br> <br>They talked about who should be in the sprint. An obvious choice was the programmer who would be responsible for building Blue Bottle&#x2019;s online store. But James also included Blue Bottle&#x2019;s chief operating officer, chief finance officer, and communications manager. He included the customer service lead who handled questions and complaints. He even included the company&#x2019;s executive chairman: Bryan Meehan, a retail expert who started a chain of organic grocery stores in the UK. And, of course, James himself would be in the room.<br> <br>The online store was essentially a software project&#x2014;something our team at GV was very familiar with. But this group looked almost nothing like a traditional software team. These were busy people, who would be missing a full week of important work. Would the sprint be worth their time?<br> <br>ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½&nbsp;&nbsp;ï¿½<br> <br>On Monday morning of our sprint week, the Blue Bottle team gathered in a conference room at GV&#x2019;s office in San Francisco. We made a diagram on the whiteboard showing how coffee buyers might move through the online store. The Blue Bottle team targeted a new customer purchasing coffee beans. James wanted to focus the sprint on this scenario because it was so difficult. If they could establish credibility and create a great experience for someone who had never heard of Blue Bottle, let alone visited their cafï¿½s or tasted their coffee, then every other situation should be easy by comparison.<br> <br>We ran into a big question: How should we organize the coffee? The shopper in this scenario would be choosing between a dozen or so varieties of bean, each in a nearly identical bag. And&#x2014;unlike in Blue Bottle&#x2019;s cafï¿½s&#x2014;there would be no barista there to help choose.<br> <br>At first, the answer seemed obvious. From boutique coffee roasters to mainstream giants like Starbucks, retailers tend to organize coffee by the geographic region where it was grown. Africa, Latin America, the Pacific. Honduran coffee vs. Ethiopian coffee. It would be logical for Blue Bottle to categorize their beans the same way.<br> <br>&#x201c;I have to admit something,&#x201d; Braden announced. Everyone turned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m into coffee, okay? I have a scale at home and everything.&#x201d; Electronic scales are the hallmark of a true coffee freak. Owning a scale meant Braden weighed the water and coffee beans so that he could experiment and adjust ratios as he brewed. We&#x2019;re talking science here. Coffee scales are accurate to a fraction of a gram.<br> <br>Braden smiled and held his hands palm up. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what the regions mean.&#x201d; There was silence. We avoided looking at James. After all, Braden&#x2019;s brave admission might be seen as heresy.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; said James. The floodgate opened. John and Jake didn&#x2019;t know the difference between coffee regions, and neither did Daniel Burka. We drank coffee together constantly, but none of us had ever admitted to our lack of sophistication.<br> <br>Then Serah Giarusso, Blue Bottle&#x2019;s customer service lead, snapped her fingers. &#x201c;What do we do in the cafï¿½s?&#x201d; she asked. After all, she went on, The Braden Situation must happen to baristas all the time: a customer comes in for coffee beans, but isn&#x2019;t sure which kind to buy.<br> <br>James is a slow and thoughtful speaker. He paused for a moment before he answered. &#x201c;The brew method is very important,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;So we train the baristas to ask the customer a simple question: &#x2018;How do you make coffee at home?&#x2019; &#x201d; James explained that, depending on whether the customer used a Chemex, or a French press, or a Mr. Coffee, or whatever, the baristas could recommend a bean to match.<br> <br>&#x201c; &#x2018;How do you make coffee at home&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x2019; &#x201d; Braden repeated. Everyone jotted notes. James had started the sprint by explaining his vision: that the online store should match the hospitality of the cafï¿½s. It felt as if we were onto something.<br> <br>The team spent the following day sketching ideas for the store. On Wednesday morning we had fifteen different solutions. That&#x2019;s too many to test with customers, so the team voted on their favorites as a way to narrow it down. Then James, the decision-maker, made the final pick of three sketches to test.<br> <br>The first sketch showed a literal approach to making the website match the cafï¿½s: It looked like the inside of a Blue Bottle cafï¿½, complete with wooden shelves. The second sketch included lots of text, to mirror the conversations baristas often have with customers. Finally, James chose a third sketch that organized coffee by brew method, bringing the &#x201c;How do you make coffee at home?&#x201d; question right onto the computer screen.<br> <br>James had chosen three competing ideas. So which one should we prototype and test? The idea of a website that looked like the cafï¿½ was the most appealing. Blue Bottle&#x2019;s aesthetic is celebrated, and a matching website would look different from anything else in the market. We had to try that idea, and it wasn&#x2019;t compatible with the other solutions. But those other solutions were also really intriguing. We couldn&#x2019;t quite decide.<br> <br>So we decided to prototype all three. After all, we didn&#x2019;t need a functioning website. To appear real in our test, each fake online store only required a few key screens. Working together with the Blue Bottle team, we used Keynote presentation software to make a series of slides that looked like three real websites. With a little ingenuity, and without any computer programming at all, we stitched those screens into a prototype that our test customers could use.<br> <br>On Friday, the team watched the customer interviews. One at a time, coffee drinkers shopped on several websites, with Blue Bottle&#x2019;s three prototypes slipped in among the competitors. (To avoid tipping off the customers, we gave each prototype a fake name.)<br> <br>Patterns emerged. The store with wooden shelves, which everyone had such high hopes for? We thought the prototype was beautiful, but customers said it was &#x201c;cheesy&#x201d; and &#x201c;not trustworthy.&#x201d; But the other two prototypes fared far better. The &#x201c;How do you make coffee at home?&#x201d; design worked seamlessly. And the &#x201c;lots of text&#x201d; design shocked us: People actually read all those words, and the extra information brought Blue Bottle&#x2019;s voice and expertise to life. As one customer said, &#x201c;These guys know coffee.&#x201d;<br> <br>James and the Blue Bottle team built confidence with their sprint. They were much closer to defining how their online store would work. What&#x2019;s more, they&#x2019;d done it in a way that felt true to their principles of hospitality. They believed the online store could be an authentic Blue Bottle experience.<br> <br>A few months later, Blue Bottle launched their new website, and their online sales growth doubled. The next year, they acquired a coffee subscription company. With a bigger team and new technology, they expanded the web store and began experimenting with new offerings. They knew it would take years to get the online store right&#x2014;but in the sprint, they started on their path.<br> The bigger the challenge, the better the sprint<p></p> <br>If you&#x2019;re starting a project that will take months or years&#x2014;like Blue Bottle and their new online store&#x2014;a sprint makes an excellent kickoff. But sprints aren&#x2019;t only for long-term projects. Here are three challenging situations where sprints can help:<br> <br>High Stakes<br> <br>Like Blue Bottle Coffee, you&#x2019;re facing a big problem and the solution will require a lot of time and money. It&#x2019;s as if you&#x2019;re the captain of a ship. A sprint is your chance to check the navigation charts and steer in the right direction before going full steam ahead.<br> <br>Not Enough Time<br> <br>You&#x2019;re up against a deadline, like Savioke rushing to get their robot ready for the hotel pilot. You need good solutions, fast. As the name suggests, a sprint is built for speed.<br> <br>Just Plain Stuck<br> <br>Some important projects are hard to start. Others lose momentum along the way. In these situations, a sprint can be a booster rocket: a fresh approach to problem solving that helps you escape gravity&#x2019;s clutches.<br> <br>When we talk to startups about sprints, we encourage them to go after their most important problem. Running a sprint requires a lot of energy and focus. Don&#x2019;t go for the small win, or the nice-to-have project, because people won&#x2019;t bring their best efforts. They probably won&#x2019;t even clear their schedules in the first place.<br> <br>So how big is too big? Sure, sprints work great for websites and other software challenges. But what about really large, complicated problems?<br> <br>Not long ago, Jake visited his friend David Lowe, a vice president of a company called Graco that manufactures pumps and sprayers. Graco is not a small startup. They&#x2019;re a multinational company who have been in business for more than ninety years.<br> <br>The company was developing a new kind of industrial pump&#x2014;a machine used in assembly lines. David, the VP, wondered if a sprint might help lower the risk of the project. After all, it would take eighteen months and millions of dollars to design and manufacture the new pump. How could he be sure they were on the right track?<br> <br>Jake doesn&#x2019;t know anything about industrial assembly lines, but out of curiosity, he joined a meeting with the engineering team. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be honest,&#x201d; Jake said. &#x201c;An industrial pump sounds too complicated to prototype and test in a week.&#x201d;<br> <br>But the team wouldn&#x2019;t give up so easily. If limited to just five days, they could prototype a brochure for the pump&#x2019;s new features and try it in sales visits. That kind of test could answer questions about marketability.<br> <br>But what about the pump itself? The engineers had ideas for that, too. To test ease-of-use, they could 3D print new nozzles and attach them to existing pumps. To test installation, they could bring cables and hoses to nearby manufacturing plants and get reactions from assembly line workers. These tests wouldn&#x2019;t be perfect. But they would answer big questions, before the pump even existed.<br> <br>Jake was wrong. The industrial pump wasn&#x2019;t too complicated for a sprint. The team of engineers accepted the five-day constraint and used their domain expertise to think creatively. They sliced the challenge into important questions, and shortcuts started to appear.<br> <br>The lesson? No problem is too large for a sprint. Yes, this statement sounds absurd, but there are two big reasons why it&#x2019;s true. First, the sprint forces your team to focus on the most pressing questions. Second, the sprint allows you to learn from just the surface of a finished product. Blue Bottle could use a slide show to prototype the surface of a website&#x2014;before they built the software and inventory processes to make it really work. Graco could use a brochure to prototype the surface of a sales conversation&#x2014;before they engineered and built the product they were selling.<br> Solve the surface first<p></p> <br>The surface is important. It&#x2019;s where your product or service meets customers. Human beings are complex and fickle, so it&#x2019;s impossible to predict how they&#x2019;ll react to a brand-new solution. When our new ideas fail, it&#x2019;s usually because we were overconfident about how well customers would understand and how much they would care.<br> <br>Get that surface right, and you can work backward to figure out the underlying systems or technology. Focusing on the surface allows you to move fast and answer big questions before you commit to execution, which is why any challenge, no matter how large, can benefit from a sprint.</p><h2>ESV Single Column Journaling Bible (Customizable Cover)</h2><p><p><strong>Personalize Your ESV Single Column Journaling Bible with a Fully Customizable Cover</strong></p><p>In addition to providing a place for readers to capture&nbsp;notes, prayers, thoughts, and reflections within the pages of their Bible, this edition features a fully customizable cover allowing for even more creativity on the Bible's exterior.

The goal behind Cook's work is to actively involve young people in fun, memorable stories and teach them to become lifelong problem solvers. Inspiration for her books comes from working with children and carefully listening to counselors, parents, and teachers, in order to stay on top of needs in the classroom and at home. Cook has the innate ability to enter the worldview of a child through storybooks, giving children both the "what to say" and the "how to say it."</p>I applaud Julia and the ALICE Training Institute for providing education to our young students about potential school intruders through "I'm Not Scared...I'm Prepared!" While it is a scary subject, it s also a genuine threat, and students as well as staff deserve preparation. "I'm Not Scared...I'm Prepared!" helps students envision their reaction to an intruder prior to an incident. Because students are accustomed to the step-by-step ways schools normally function, it's important to show them that there is no singular response to these dynamic events. --Joey Melvin - Former School Resource Officer and Deputy Director of The Comprehensive School Safety Plan, Delaware Department of Safety and Homeland Security/Delaware Capitol Police.<br><br>Administrators/Educators, "I'm Not Scared...I'm Prepared!" is a brilliant, proactive way of educating children how to handle lockdown and evacuation situations. Julia has certainly created a dynamic tool for educators to talk to children in "kid terms" about what to do if there is an intruder in the building. The Sheep, The Shepherd and The Wolf Drill will empower communities nationwide to improve school safety. --Erin E. Bowden M.S.

It was from other field hands that she first heard about the Underground Railroad which she travelled by herself north to Philadelphia. Throughout her long life (she died at the age of ninety-two) and long after the Civil War brought an end to slavery, this amazing woman was proof of what just one person can do.</p><p>Yona Zeldis McDonough is a longtime doll lover and collector. She is also an award-winning author who has published numerous books for children and adults. She presently lives in Brooklyn with her husband and two children.<p><b>Who Was Harriet Tubman?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> No one knows the exact year in which Harriet Tubman was born. It may have been 1820 or 1821. Most people didn&#x2019;t think the birth of an enslaved person was worth remembering. Harriet Tubman would grow into a brave and daring young woman. She was brave enough to escape from slavery. She was daring enough to help others escape, too. Because she led so many to freedom, she was called &#x201c;Moses.&#x201d; Like Moses in the Bible, Harriet Tubman believed that her people should be free. And she risked her life many times to help them become free. Even after she had escaped safely from the South, she went back to take other slaves north to freedom. Here is her story.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1:&nbsp;Life in Maryland</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometime around 1820 in Maryland, an enslaved woman named Harriet Ross gave birth to a baby girl. Neither Harriet, who was called Old Rit, nor her husband, Ben, could read or write, so they couldn&#x2019;t record the year of the baby&#x2019;s birth. No one else thought it was worth doing. But Old Rit loved her tiny child and wanted to protect her. She hoped her little girl, whose nickname was Minty, would learn to sew, cook, or weave. Then she could avoid the backbreaking work picking crops like tobacco, corn, or wheat in the fields.<br> &nbsp;<br> Old Rit and Ben had been born into slavery. They had many children, all of whom were also enslaved. Ever since 1619, when black people from Africa were kidnapped and brought on slave ships to Virginia, slavery had been a part of American life. By the early 1800s, most of the Northern states had stopped slavery. But the Southern states had not.<br> &nbsp;<br> Enslaved people like Ben and Old Rit worked very hard, yet they were not paid for their work. Instead, Ben and Old Rit lived on land owned by their enslaver, a man named Mr. Brodas. This land and the many buildings on it was called a plantation.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. Brodas&#x2019;s plantation house was large and grand, like so many of those in the South. Ben and Old Rit could see the Brodases&#x2019; big house every day, but they didn&#x2019;t live there. They lived in a log cabin, like the other enslaved people on the plantation. These cabins were very small. They had no windows. The floors were made of dirt. Piles of worn-out blankets were the only beds. Still, for little Minty, this was home.<br> &nbsp;<br> As soon as she could walk, Minty joined her brothers and sisters and other enslaved children who were watched by an older slave. The littlest children weren&#x2019;t forced to work&#x2014;yet. There were even times when Minty and the other children could play and have fun. Summers were warm and bright. They swam and fished in the many streams and creeks.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Unlike many enslaved children, Minty lived with her loving parents. Her father told her stories about the woods. He could name the birds. He knew which berries were sweet and tasty.<br> &nbsp;<br> Minty&#x2019;s mother told her stories from the Bible. From her mother, Minty learned about Moses. Moses had lived thousands of years before. He led his people, the Hebrews, out of Egypt, where they had been slaves, and into freedom.<br> &nbsp;<br> Around 1826, when Minty turned six, her life changed. Mr. Brodas hired her out. This meant that she had to leave her parents and her home. She had to go live and work for white people who could not afford to buy a slave of their own. The day she had to leave, a wagon came to take her away. Minty did not want to go. Her two older sisters had been sent away. She remembered how they cried and cried. But they had to go anyway. So did Minty.<br> &nbsp;<br> Minty worked for a woman named Mrs. Cook. Mrs. Cook was a weaver. She spent her days in front of a big, noisy loom. Minty helped her wind the yarn. The air was filled with fuzz and lint. It made Minty cough. She couldn&#x2019;t concentrate. She dropped the yarn. Mrs. Cook got angry. When she was angry, she would punish Minty by whipping her. Enslaved people were often beaten or whipped.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mrs. Cook told her husband that Minty was stupid and slow. So Mr. Cook had her help him instead. He was trying to catch muskrats. He set out traps by the river. It was Minty&#x2019;s job to watch them.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was cold near the river. One day Minty woke up feeling sick. Mrs. Cook thought she was pretending so she wouldn&#x2019;t have to work. Just as always, Mr. Cook sent Minty out to check the traps. She went down to the river, shivering from fever. When she got back, Mrs. Cook saw that she was really sick. She sent Minty home to her parents to get well. Old Rit took care of Minty for six weeks. But then it was back to Mrs. Cook and the loom. Minty could not do the job. The Cooks sent her home again.<br> &nbsp;<br> Next, Mr. Brodas hired Minty out to a woman named Miss Susan. Minty, who was only about seven, had to watch Miss Susan&#x2019;s baby. If the baby cried, Minty was whipped. At night she sat by the baby&#x2019;s cradle. She rocked it gently. But Minty was tired. She would fall asleep and the baby would begin to cry. Then Miss Susan would get angry at being woken, and Minty was whipped again. Minty learned to stay alert for the baby, but it was hard. She was always tired.<br> &nbsp;<br> Once, when Miss Susan&#x2019;s back was turned, Minty reached for a lump of sugar that was in a bowl on the table. She had never tasted sugar. It looked so good. But Miss Susan saw her. Furious, she reached for&nbsp; the whip. Minty was too fast. Out the door she flew. She did not stop running until she was sure Miss Susan was no longer chasing her. But now what? If she went back, she would face a whipping.<br> &nbsp;<br> Minty found a pigpen. She crawled inside to hide. She was very young, but she was bold. She tried to fight the piglets for potato peelings and other scraps of food. But the mother pig pushed Minty away.<br> &nbsp;<br> After five days, Minty was filthy and starving. She knew she would have to return to Miss Susan. Later Minty would say, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t have anywhere else to go, even though I knew what was coming.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Instead of being hired out again, Minty was sent back to Mr. Brodas. Now Minty had to work in the fields, which was very hard. She split logs, loaded wood onto wagons, worked the plow, and drove oxen. When she was out in the fields, Minty could see the sky and feel the wind. The others talked while they worked. That was how Minty began to hear new ideas. She heard people say they wanted to be free. Some of them escaped from the plantation.<br> &nbsp;<br> They went north, to freedom. Others, like Nat Turner, started rebellions to end slavery. Nat Turner was caught and killed. But his ideas didn&#x2019;t die. More and more, enslaved people thought about being free. Late one day in 1834, Mr. Brodas&#x2019;s slaves gathered with those from another plantation to shuck corn. They sang while they worked, peeling the pale green husks from the golden ears of corn. One man stood apart. Minty watched him. He began moving across the big field. At first the overseer&#x2014;the man who kept the slaves in line&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t notice. The slave was halfway across when the overseer saw him. He shouted for him to return. The man kept going.<br> &nbsp;<br> The overseer followed, holding his big whip. Minty followed, too. The overseer was running now, chasing the man. The runaway ducked into a store. The overseer cornered him in the store, then called to Minty. He wanted her to help him tie up the runaway slave. But Minty didn&#x2019;t move. She stood watching the two men. Suddenly, the man pushed past the overseer and was out of the store. Gone.<br> &nbsp;<br> As for Minty, she blocked the doorway, so the overseer couldn&#x2019;t follow him. The overseer picked up a heavy, two-pound weight and threw it at the runaway. The weight missed him, but it hit Minty on the forehead. She fell, unconscious and bleeding. She was brought to Old Rit, who nursed her tenderly. No one thought Minty would live. Still, Old Rit cared for her daughter night and day. Eventually, Minty recovered from the wound, though it left a scar on her forehead.<br> &nbsp;<br> It wasn&#x2019;t just the scar that made Minty different now. People treated her with respect. Although she was only thirteen or fourteen, she had defied an overseer. No longer was she called by her childhood name of Minty. Instead, she was called Harriet, her mother&#x2019;s name. Clearly, she was not a child anymore.</p></p><h2>Blackjack Basic Strategy Chart: 4/6/8 Decks, Dealer Stands on All 17s (2-sided card)</h2><p>Convenient wallet-sized plastic blackjack basic strategy card.

She has protruding front teeth, thick glasses, and some very unusual hobbies, including interpretive dance and fungus identification. She's intense and passionate--and her peers don't always get her. But surely there are other mushroom lovers out there? As Sweety sets out to find them, she comes to realize--with a little help from her cool Aunt Ruth-- that being Sweety is actually pretty awesome. With heart and humor and a whole lot of charm, Andrea Zuill delivers a story about learning to embrace everything that makes you <i>you</i>--and that's something many kids are going to relate to.</p><p><b>Andrea Zuill </b>is the author-illustrator of <i>Wolf Camp,</i> a finalist for the Children's Choice Award. In a starred review, <i>Kirkus</i> said the book "will delight more than dog lovers." She is also the author-illustrator of <i>Dance Is for Everyone </i>and <i>Marigold &amp; Daisy</i>. Her work has been exhibited in galleries in California, Texas, and New York, including the San Diego Museum of Art and the Brand Library gallery, where she won the Disney Imagineering Award. Visit her at andreazuill.org or follow her on Twitter at @AndreaZuill.K-Gr 2&#x2014;Sweety is a particularly awkward naked mole rat. She doesn't always fit in with her classmates. She likes different things, like mushrooms and interpretive dance. Her grandmother calls her a square peg, but Aunt Ruth understands her. Aunt Ruth is a square peg herself and explains to Sweety that if the young mole rat stays true to herself, she will find her people. Sweety wonders who "her people" are and how will they recognize one another. Will there be a secret handshake? Sweety is indeed awkward, with head gear to pull her prominent front teeth together and thick eyeglasses. Pen-and-ink drawings, scanned and colored digitally in a washed color palette, depict the naked mole rats in clothing and other humanlike elements. Drawn with lots of squiggly black lines, tiny eyes, bald heads, and spindly limbs, the cast of characters could be described as adorable and dorky. Composition varies from page to page, ranging from spreads to multiple vignettes. The touching and comedic prose, dotted with an occasional conversation bubble, pairs perfectly with the adorkable characters. Square pegs rejoice, Zuill has created a worthy addition to her lineup of whimsical and lovable character-filled picture books.

The Bible says that &#x201c;all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.&#x201d;2 It is because of this sin, this disobedience towards God, that every person is separated from him: &#x201c;your iniquities have made a separation&nbsp;between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear.&#x201d;3 And even worse isthe consequence of sin, eternal separation from God&#x2015;&#x201c;the wages [cost] of sin is death.&#x201d;4</p><p>However, in his love and mercy, God sent his sinless Son, Jesus, to pay the price of our sins&#x2019;debt. Almost 2000 years ago, Jesus Christ died on a cross, was buried, and then rose from the dead on the third day.5 It is only through the death of Jesus that we can be reconciled to God. And through his death, God offers the free gift of eternal life to all who believe in his name.6</p><p>There is no greater hope than this&#x2015;the assurance of eternal life offered to us through Jesus Christ, and his promise to stay with us and sustain us in all circumstances:</p><p><em>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? ...For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor power, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord</em>.7</p><p>God offers this hope to you today. To accept his offer, begin by admitting that you are a sinner separated from God and in need of his forgiveness. Then trust only in Christ to save you from the consequences of your sins. Believe that Jesus died for your sins on the cross, and was raised from the dead in order to conquer death, bridging the gap caused by sin between you and God. Accept Jesus&#x2019; offer to come into your life as your Savior.</p><p>If you sincerely desire to have hope in Christ, tell God in words like these:</p><p><em>&#x201c;Dear God, I admit that I am a sinner and need your forgiveness. Thank you for sending Jesus to suffer the punishment that I deserve for my sins. Please help me every day to turn from my sin and live a life that pleases you. Thank you for your gift of eternal life and for the hope I now have in you. &nbsp;Amen.&#x201d;</em></p><p>Scripture references (ESV): &nbsp;1 John 10:10, 2Romans 3:23, 3Isaiah 59:2, 4Romans 6:23, 51 Corinthians 15:3-4, 6Romans 3:23, John 3:36, 7Romans 8:35,38-39, 8Romans 15:13.</p></p><p></p><h2>Meal Planner: Track And Plan Your Meals Weekly (52 Week Food Planner / Diary / Log / Journal / Calendar): Meal Prep And Planning Grocery List</h2><p>Make your week easier by planning out your meals with this adorable notebook!

Nothing to Prove! Nothing to Fear!</b> Men have a glorious and significant role in God's larger Story. They also are the target of a special warfare aimed continually and ruthlessly at the center of their being... their masculine hearts. Naivety and ignorance keep many men running in circles while misinformation and poor training keep many more in bondage. Men are wounded and being crushed under the weight of criticism and expectations. The attempted solutions of recent years have been through mere education; tell men what they are doing wrong and give them a list to memorize. What if we are setting men up for failure rather than helping them find freedom?</p><p>This is a book about being a Beloved Son, "receiving love" from God and the affect that will have in settling a man's heart. Then, and only then is the foundation set for a man to enter the Battle. Thompson shares why he wrote the book: "I hope to one day see the hearts of men so foundationally settled, so well-trained, so well-equipped, and so well-engaged that when evil dare raise its head, Beloved Sons/Warrior men will know what to do and will do it well." Join Michael Thompson, as he invites men to a place of training and orientation that will ensure both a settled heart and a fierce courage. A man cannot enter this battle without experiencing that he is a Beloved Son. After all, that is what the battle is all about!</p></p><p></p><h2>Leaves</h2><p>This simple, charming story of a young bear's first autumn is perfectly suited to board book format. Bear is surprised when the leaves start falling off the trees, but when he tries to reattach them, it doesn't work. Eventually, he gets sleepy, and burrows into the fallen leaves for a long nap. When he wakes up, it's spring-and there are suddenly brand-new leaves all around, seeming to welcome him.<p> With its childlike main character and graceful illustrations, Leaves is a great way to teach the youngest children about the changing seasons.<br><br></p></p><p>David Ezra Stein received the Ezra Jack Keats New Writer Award for Leaves, which was also a <i>Publishers Weekly</i> Best Book of the Year, a <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> Editor's Choice and a <i>School Library Journal</i> Best Book. He also wrote and illustrated <i>Pouch!</i>, <i>The Nice Book</i> and <i>Monster Hug!</i> He lives in Kew Gardens, New York.<i>Starred Review.</i> Stein's (<i>Cowboy Ned and Andy</i>) pen-and-ink illustrations conjure a place readers will wish they could visit, a tiny island that pokes up out of a bay. Drawn in mossy greens and golds, the island is home to a very young bear&#x2014;so young that when the leaves start falling in the autumn, he's a little shocked: He tried to catch them and put them back on... but it was not the same. The bear doesn't despair; he grows sleepy, goes off to hibernate and wakes in the spring. This set of events is depicted in a series of panels trained on the entrance to the bear's den; the single tree above it loses its leaves, is blanketed by snow, and receives visits first by a rabbit and then by a pair of cardinals.) Eventually the bear sticks his head back out to greet the spring sunshine and spies the tiny buds on the trees. 'Welcome!' he cried. And, he thought, the leaves welcomed him. Many things contribute to the success of Stein's tale: the joyously colored panels that hang on the pages like paintings&#x2014;more intimate, somehow, than double-page spreads&#x2014;the island's eight trees and their leaves, which seem lively and animate and entirely worthy of friendship; the innocence of the bear; and Stein's willingness to let the story assume its own haiku-like shape. His autumnal pictures seem to glow, while the bear himself has the irresistible appeal of a well-loved toy.

His love of drawing led him to earn a BFA in illustration from Savannah College of Art and Design. Alex has exhibited in art galleries and has painted murals, theater sets, and squirmy kids' faces, but his true love has always been children's books. He lives in Chicago with his dog, Harley. <i>Jasper &amp; Ollie</i> is Alex's first book. See more of his work at alexwillan.com, and follow him on Instagram at @alexwillan.PreS-Gr 1-Jasper the fox and Ollie the sloth are having breakfast when Jasper asks his friend if he wants to go to the pool. Not waiting for the sloth's answer, he challenges Ollie to race him there and flies out the door, pulling on his trunks outside. Not surprisingly, Jasper arrives first and becomes exasperated waiting for Ollie to arrive, convinced that he must have snuck in unnoticed. While Ollie takes his time, a frenetic Jasper turns the place upside down looking for his friend and gets tossed out by the hippo lifeguard for pulling an alarm. When Ollie finally arrives, Jasper suggests that they go to the beach together instead. Willan's colorful cartoonish illustrations borrow some comic book elements, mixing full page spreads with split frames that depict the friends' contrasting journey towards the pool, multiple perspective shifts, using a dotted red line to trace the fox's path, and speech balloons as the story's only narration mechanism. The blocky stylized animals are highly expressive, from the fox's frenzied impatience, the annoyance of the animals at the pool and the delighted dillydallying of the lackadaisical sloth. VERDICT A hilarious and lively romp that sneaks in a message about the importance of patience and will have its readers hoping for some follow-up adventures of the "odd couple" friends.-Yelena Voysey, formerly at Pickering Educational Library, Boston University&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

Never fear, this smart cookie has a plan to outfox the fox. Will it work? Let?s just say that the ending is sweet for everyone.<p> ?Ernst?s familiar art, here placed against gingham-check backgrounds, utilizes the oversize format to best advantage, with large characters leaping out of their frames. On the cover, the candy-studded Gingerbread Girl with licorice-whip hair stares boldly out at readers. Kids won?t be able to resist following her inside.??<i>Booklist</i><br><br></p></p><p>Lisa Campbell Ernst is the author-illustrator of<i> The Turn-Around, Upside-Down Alphabet Book</i> and many other popular picture books. She lives in Kansas City, Missouri.PreSchool-Grade 2&#x2013;Not as substantial a story as that of the unfortunate gingerbread boy, Ernst's confectionary tale is, nevertheless, entertaining. Like her brother, this perky pastry, covered from head to toe in candies, bolts from the oven and outruns a farm family, a pig, an artist, a cow and her calf, a dog walker, and some children at recess&#x2013;before jumping onto the same fox's back. However, by using a strand of her licorice-whip hair to lasso the hungry creature, the Gingerbread Girl proves that she is one sharp cookie who knows how to turn around a sticky situation. Large, pleasantly appealing cartoon illustrations are set upon pale backgrounds of blue, mauve, tan, and green gingham. Despite the forced rhyme of the protagonist's speech (I can leap past piggy/Like all of the others./This story will not end/Like that of my brother's!) and a couple of unnecessary remarks made by the fox ( Anyone could tell by looking at her that she was an airhead), the story provides enough amusement to make it appealing&#x2013;but not a first purchase.<i>&#x2013;Susan Scheps, Shaker Heights Public Library, OH</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Great learning at home and in the classroom.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman, M.A., is the author and co-author of hundreds popular storybooks and workbooks for children. Among the titles are <em>Peter&#x2019;s Dream</em>, <em>I Don&#x2019;t Like Peas</em>, and <em>The New Bike</em> (the latter two published under the pen name Marie Vinje), the <em>Get Ready for Preschool</em>, <em>Kindergarten</em>, and<em> First Grade </em>workbook trio, along with the entire Get Ready, Little Thinker, I Know It!, Try-n-Spy, and Little Busy Book workbook series.</p> <p>She is also co-founder, along with her late husband James Hoffman, Ph.D., of School Zone Publishing. Visionary in business, she has long looked at the world through a child&#x2019;s eyes, infusing her stories and lessons with joy and relatability.</p> <p>&nbsp;As a mother of 4 back in the &#x2018;70s, like moms the world over throughout history, she wanted what was best for her children. And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents. Her husband lent his blended talents of educator and entrepreneur. A professor of education who also had first-hand experience as an elementary teacher, he was involved in teacher education programs at several colleges and had served at the helm of a company that published classroom materials.</p> <p>Combining rock-solid editorial judgment and creative instincts with a thorough understanding of early education, Joan Hoffman was an exemplary proponent of design thinking long before it became a conceptual label. An innovative problem-solver, she has always sought to reach out to end users and challenge convention. Separating fleeting trends from legitimate advances has been essential to her company&#x2019;s longevity.</p> <p>The results speak for themselves. With the next generation&#x2014;both son Jonathan and daughter Jennifer&#x2014;taking on creative and strategic leadership roles in the company their parents started, School Zone seamlessly integrated digital learning platforms. The company received Apple&#x2019;s exclusive Human Interface Design Excellence Award for software development, and its apps were part of the first-generation iPad launch in 2010. School Zone&#x2019;s flagship product, the Little Scholar Learning Tablet, has earned industry-wide recognition and awards, as has its online learning destination Anywhere Teacher. Inspired by mom&#x2019;s story-telling excellence, son Jonathan continued that legacy with Charlie &amp; Company, an original series for ages 3-7, available on Oznnoz, Kidoodle.tv, ToonGoggles, BatteryPop, Ameba, and Highbrow.</p> <p>Joan Hoffman says, &#x201c;It is incredibly rewarding to see the children and grandchildren of some of our original customers enjoying our ever-evolving books, apps, flash cards, games, music, and other products&#x2014;both print and digital.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br> In 2019 School Zone celebrates its 40th anniversary, spanning portions of five decades and having sold more than 370 million educational products. Hoffman continues to be hands-on in the company, still writing, still envisioning, and still putting kids, parents, and teachers first.</p>We use these with struggling kindergarten &amp; first grade students. The kids love doing them and they facilitate learning the alphabet but also help them with sequence and paying attention because the next letter is not necessarily the closest one. Makes learning fun. --Amazon<br><br>Though this is book only has 32 dot-to-dot pictures, it is good quality. The book starts out with connecting dots from A to J. The puzzles graduate up one letter at a time, in order. The number of puzzles that range the full alphabet are 10, which is over 30% of the book. A plus as far as I am concerned, since that is what I want my grandson to practice. I wish this book was bigger. I definitely would be willing to pay more for more puzzles. --Amazon<br><br>Good way to start children to search for letters as they may need to repeat the alphabet to finish drawing. Encourages connecting of dots more accurately as to drawing all over, so again learning hand/eye coordination to draw the line segment. Always a surprise at the end of the final drawing to what the picture really is and now can be colored to their liking. Great fun for children struggling with the alphabet. --Amazon</p><h2>I&#39;m a Homeowner, Now What?

In the beginning they were quite small but over time they evolved into the varied and fascinating creatures that captivate our imaginations today. What we know about dinosaurs is evolving, too! We've learned that some dinosaurs were good parents, that dinosaurs could grow new teeth when old ones fell out, and that most dinosaurs walked on two legs. We've even discovered that birds are modern relatives of dinosaurs!</p><p>Megan Stine has written several books for young readers, including <i>Where Is the White House?</i>, <i>Who Was Marie Curie?, Who Was Ulysses S. Grant?, Who Is Michelle Obama?</i>, and <i>Who Was Sally Ride?</i> She lives in Clinton, Connecticut.<b>What Was the Age of the Dinosaurs?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1822, a young country doctor named Gideon Mantell was living in Sussex, England. He delivered babies and treated people with serious diseases.<br> &nbsp;<br> But Mantell had another passion as well. Ever since childhood, he had loved to collect fossils&#x2014;the ancient remains of dead plants and animals. Whenever he could, the busy doctor spent time digging near the chalky cliffs of England&#x2019;s coastline. At first what he dug up were small pieces of fossil bones. But as time went on, he began to find some big bones&#x2014;really big ones. The bones were too big to belong to any known animal. Even elephant bones would have been smaller.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then one day, Mantell&#x2019;s wife, Mary, found a few enormous fossil teeth. She brought them to her husband.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> What were they? What kind of animal could possibly have teeth as big as this?<br> &nbsp;<br> Mantell wasn&#x2019;t sure what to think. He talked to other scientists. No one could agree about what they were. A man named William Buckland had once been given some huge bones. He studied them for six years and finally decided they belonged to a giant lizard no one had ever seen before. Buckland called it <i>Megalosaurus</i> (say: MEG-uh-lo-SORE-us), which means &#x201c;big lizard.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Mantell asked Buckland about the huge teeth he had found. But Buckland didn&#x2019;t think they had come from a creature similar to his <i>Megalosaurus</i>. He said they came from a fish!<br> &nbsp;<br> After that, Mantell went to a museum and looked at other fossils and animal skeletons on display. The teeth he had found looked exactly like iguana teeth&#x2014;only many times larger. If they came from an iguana, it would have to have been at least sixty feet long! That&#x2019;s as long as a house!<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly Mantell realized something exciting. Like Buckland, he had discovered a new kind of animal no one knew about. He decided to call it <i>Iguanodon</i> (ig-WAN-uh-don).<br> &nbsp;<br> Neither Mantell nor Buckland understood that they had stumbled onto a completely unknown group of animals. The word <i>dinosaur</i> hadn&#x2019;t been invented yet&#x2014;and wouldn&#x2019;t be for another twenty years. But that&#x2019;s what <i>Megalosaurus</i> and <i>Iguanodon </i>were. In the early nineteenth century, no one yet realized that in prehistoric times, gigantic animals had roamed the earth. But soon, more fossils were found, and slowly scientists began to put together the pieces of a long-lost world&#x2014;the Age of the Dinosaurs.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chapter 1</b>: <b>The Prehistoric World</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Two hundred thirty million years ago, the Age of the Dinosaurs began. The first baby dinosaurs poked their heads out of their eggshells and looked around for something to eat.<br> &nbsp;<br> The earth was a very different place then. North America didn&#x2019;t exist. Neither did Africa or Europe. All seven continents we know today were clumped together into one huge landmass that we call Pangaea (pan-JEE-uh).&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Pangaea was surrounded on all sides by water. The center of the huge continent was a hot desert, where not much could survive. A giant ocean covered the rest of the earth. Near the coastlines, the ocean cooled the air. Cool air and water made it possible for fabulous life-forms to develop. Ferns grew along the coast. Moss covered the rocks. There were forests of pine trees and palm trees. Spiders and beetles crawled about.<br> &nbsp;<br> The ocean was full of life. There were huge swimming reptiles&#x2014;animals like lizards and turtles, only bigger. Some, called ichthyosaurs (ICK-thee-oh-sores), looked much more like dolphins or fish. They were predators that hunted fish. Others, called plesiosaurs (PLEE-see-oh-sores), were more like gigantic shell-less turtles with incredibly long necks. They may have eaten baby ichthyosaurs for lunch.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reptiles also dominated the land at that time. There were none of the animals we know today&#x2014;no dogs, cats, giraffes, monkeys, or apes. There weren&#x2019;t even any birds&#x2014;and definitely no people! It was mostly a reptile&#x2019;s world, although the ancient reptiles were not the same reptiles we know today.<br> &nbsp;<br> This was the beginning of a time period called the Mesozoic era. It began 250 million years ago&#x2014;or 250 &#x201c;mya,&#x201d; as scientists say. It lasted until the dinosaurs died out, around 65 mya.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Mesozoic era is divided up into three parts&#x2014;Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. The very first dinosaurs appeared on earth during the last part of the Triassic, about 230 mya. Dinosaurs existed on earth for about 165 million years.<br> &nbsp;<br> When exactly did the first dinosaur appear? It&#x2019;s hard to say for sure, because dinosaurs evolved from other reptiles over millions of years. But the earliest dinosaur was probably <i>Eoraptor</i> (EE-oh-RAP-tor)&#x2014;a small animal weighing between eight and twenty-two pounds. With jagged teeth, long legs, and long claws, it was a small, quick, deadly predator. It lived in the forest, where it chased and captured smaller creatures. It probably ate plants, too.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> As millions of years went by, different kinds of dinosaurs came into being. How did that happen? The answer lies in evolution.<br> &nbsp;<br> Evolution is the name for changes that occur in living things over time. Charles Darwin was a scientist in the nineteenth century who studied nature. He wrote a famous book about the idea of evolution. Darwin said that, in each species, some would survive longer than others. It was not just a matter of luck. Those that survived were the best suited to thrive in the world. They lived long enough to have babies that would be born with the same strong traits. Animals of the same species without those traits didn&#x2019;t live as long. In time, they died out.<br> &nbsp;<br> Darwin explained that over thousands and millions of years, all kinds of species developed&#x2014;including human beings, who evolved from ape-like creatures.</p><h2>Disney Princess Cinderella, Belle, Ariel, and More!- Me Reader Electronic Reader and 8 Sound Book Library - PI Kids</h2><p>Join the wonderful Disney Princesses on their adventures!

But as Henry tells his mother about a new friend who likes soccer and about how he&#39;ll learn to read books, he begins to realize that maybe first grade won&#39;t be so bad after all.</p><p><p>Nancy Carson lives in Bloomington, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. She and her husband, Barry McCool, have three children, two dogs, and a cat. A graduate of the Minneapolis College of Art, Nancy has kept alive a youthful zest for life. Readers and book reviewers alike are charmed by her jazzy yet childlike drawings done with bright colored pencils. In all 42 books and four stage plays, she uses well-placed humor in words and pictures to tickle the funny bone of children and their parents.&nbsp;Nancy loves nature and spends as much time outdoors as possible, running, biking and birdwatching. Besides writing and illustrating children's books, she designs posters, t-shirts, caps, greeting cards and other specialty items, which are marketed across the country through McCool Unlimited, Inc. and available though Nancy's on-line catalogue.&nbsp;</p>Kindergarten-Grade 1&#x2013;In Carlson's third book about Henry and his adventures, the mouse has just spent his first day in first grade and is not quite sure how he feels about it. However, as he describes his experiences to his mother, he realizes that for every negative (he doesn't sit near any of his old friends) there is a positive (he's made a new pal who likes soccer and spiders as much as he does). By the time he's finished with his recitation, he's excited, happy, and proud that he's a real first grader now! Children taking this monumental step will sympathize with Henry's uncertainty and be reassured by his adjustment. The vibrantly colored illustrations and the cast of animal characters have lots of child appeal. Librarians will particularly appreciate the page where Henry and his classmates are eagerly investigating the Everybody Books in the school library. Whether used for storytime or independent reading, the book is sure to find an audience.<i>&#x2013;Grace Oliff, Ann Blanche Smith School, Hillsdale, NJ</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Some of those words include: <i>the</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>for</i>, <i>above</i>, and even <i>even</i>. Put them together and you have a &#x201c;hilarious but also heartfelt&#x201d; (<i>Elle</i>) memoir on survival, success, and the importance of believing in yourself.<br><br>The question you&#x2019;re probably asking yourself right now is: What does Kevin Hart have that a book also has?<br> <br>According to the three people who have seen Kevin Hart and a book in the same room, the answer is clear:<br> <br>A book is compact. Kevin Hart is compact.<br> <br>A book has a spine that holds it together. Kevin Hart has a spine that holds him together.<br> <br>A book has a beginning. Kevin Hart&#x2019;s life uniquely qualifies him to write this book by also having a beginning.<br> <br>It begins in North Philadelphia. He was born an accident, unwanted by his parents. His father was a drug addict who was in and out of jail. His brother was a crack dealer and petty thief. And his mother was overwhelmingly strict, beating him with belts, frying pans, and his own toys.<br> <br>The odds, in short, were stacked against our young hero. But Kevin Hart, like Ernest Hemingway, J.K. Rowling, and Chocolate Droppa before him, was able to defy the odds and turn it around. In his literary debut, he takes us on a journey through what his life was, what it is today, and how he&#x2019;s overcome each challenge to become the man he is today.<br> <br>And that man happens to be the biggest comedian in the world, with tours that sell out football stadiums and films that have collectively grossed over $3.5 billion.<br> <br>He achieved this not just through hard work, determination, and talent. &#x201c;Hart is an incredibly magnetic storyteller, on the page as he is onstage, and that&#x2019;s what shines through [in this] genial, entertaining guide to a life in comedy&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>).</p><p>Kevin Hart is an award-winning actor and comedian.

Typically, it&#x2019;s spoken while pulling your neck back, raising your eyebrows, and quickly scanning the room to make sure everything looks normal and you&#x2019;re not in some weird-ass dream.<br> <br>The dictionary definition of the word is: &#x201c;Did you just say what I think you said? Because it literally makes no sense and my mind can&#x2019;t process it right now, so I&#x2019;m going to have to ask you to repeat it.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s the kind of thing you might say when your dad comes home bleeding and tells you that someone hacked him up with an axe.<br> <br>(This really happened, people. I can&#x2019;t make this up.)<br> <br>The second word is: &#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>This is pronounced with a silent &#x201c;t,&#x201d; and it generally follows a few seconds after a Huh. It&#x2019;s spoken with your mouth contorted into a look of disgust and your forehead creased, while looking at someone like they&#x2019;re batshit crazy.<br> <br>It is short for: &#x201c;What the hell did you just say? Because I only asked you to repeat the crazy shit you just said, and now you&#x2019;re adding some even crazier shit on top of it. My ears can&#x2019;t believe what they&#x2019;re hearing right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s the kind of thing you might say when your dad, whose head is busted open and wrapped in a blood-soaked towel, assures you that he&#x2019;s fine and doesn&#x2019;t need to go to the hospital and just wants to lie down for a little bit.<br> <br>The third word is: &#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s spoken with a shoulder shrug, a side-to-side shake of the head, and a roll of the eyes. It means: &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t even begin to fathom your reality, but I&#x2019;ve decided to just accept it and move on.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s what you say when a Huh and a What have gotten you nowhere, and you&#x2019;re starting to think that maybe you actually are stuck in a dream and shouldn&#x2019;t eat pizza before bedtime anymore. Like when your dad tells you that the reason someone hacked him up with an axe was because he was jealous of his skills as a refrigerator repairman.<br> <br>This all may seem unbelievable to anyone who hasn&#x2019;t met my father, but this is the honest-to-God truth. In life, you can choose to cry about the bullshit that happens to you or you can choose to laugh about it.<br> <br>I chose laughter.<br> <br>These are the stories behind the jokes, and a few lessons I&#x2019;ve figured out about life, success, family, and relationships along the way.<br> <br>Actually, I&#x2019;m still working on the relationships part, but the rest I got down.</p><h2>Touch and Feel: Fire Engine</h2><p><p>Perfect for the child who wants to know everything about fire trucks, this sturdy book is filled with clear and realistic photography, simple text, and fun textures that encourage tactile exploration and help develop fine motor skills while building an early language foundation.</p><p>Featuring pictures of everything related to fire engines, <i>Touch and Feel: Fire Engine</i> brightly displays big red trucks including textures on the pages to keep young children engaged.</p><p>With appealing touch-and-feel elements on every spread, DK's Touch and Feel series is a favorite for both parents and children, in a larger format than DK's Baby Touch and Feel books.

Tozer illuminates God&#39;s attributes-from wisdom, to grace, to mercy-and in doing so, attempts to restore the majesty and wonder of God in the hearts and minds of all Christians. It teaches us how we can rejuvenate our prayer life, meditate more reverently, understand God more deeply and experience God&#39;s presence in our daily lives.</p><p>Aiden Wilson Tozer was an American evangelical pastor, speaker, writer, and editor. After coming to Christ at the age of seventeen, Tozer found his way into the Christian &amp; Missionary Alliance denomination where he served for over forty years.

Born into poverty in western Pennsylvania in 1897, Tozer died in May 1963 a self-educated man who had taught himself what he missed in high school and college due to his home situation.

I think I'm kind of cool.<br> - </em>Whoopi Goldberg</p> <p> "I can't go to school like this!" I wailed as I stared into my mirror, hating my face, my body and life in general. A river of salty tears traced a path down my cheeks. Summoned from the kitchen by my shrieking, my mother appeared at my side a second later.</p> <p>"What's the problem?" she asked patiently.</p> <p>"Everything . . . just everything!" I complained and continued to stare horrified into the mirror.</p> <p>At almost thirteen, the problems that I felt I had were overwhelming. I had a hideous new crop of angry, red pimples that had erupted on my forehead and chin overnight&#x2014;every night. My hair suddenly looked greasy all the time, even though I washed it every second day. My aching tummy signaled that my newfound "friend" was about to visit once again, causing my jeans to fit too snugly and make me appear as though I had been eating nothing but hot fudge sundaes. And to top it off, my chewed-up fingernails were torn and bloody, since biting them seemed to go along with the way I worried about how other people perceived me. But everything that was bothering me wasn't just on the surface&#x2014;I also had a broken heart.</p> <p>The guy I had been going out with had recently dumped me in favor of an older, more developed girl. Everything combined, I was a physical and emotional wreck.</p> <p>"Come on, now, Honey. Try not to cry," my mother said with a smile. "I remember what it was like to be your age. It was awkward and frustrating, and I got my heart stomped on, too, but I came through it&#x2014;and so will you! It's not as bad as you think, and once you get to school with all your friends, you'll forget all about your pimples and what's-his-name, and one day you'll look back on this and wonder why you were ever so upset."</p> <p>Convinced that she didn't know what she was talking about, I gave her a dirty look and headed off for school, greeting my girlfriends on the sidewalk while my mother waved encouragingly from the front door. Later, as much as I hated to admit it, I found out that my mother was right. As I spent time with my friends who were going through the same things that I was, my mind wasn't on my troubles anymore, and soon I was laughing.</p> <p>When I returned home later that day, I was in a much better mood and because I had put my best foot forward, my mother rewarded me with a bag of goodies she had purchased from the drugstore. On my bed was a bag that included shampoo and conditioner, some acne medication, a gift certificate to a hair salon and, surprisingly, some hot, new shades of nail polish.</p> <p>"What on earth is this?" I asked bewildered, thinking that my mother had to be out of her mind if she thought I was going to flaunt my gnarled nails.</p> <p>As it turned out, she had a plan. I thought that it was cruel at the time, yet it turned out to be highly effective. I wasn't allowed to have any of the stuff in the bag, nor was I allowed to keep my ever-so-important stick of concealer. The deal was that for each week that I didn't bite my fingernails, one item of my choice would be returned to me. Desperate to retrieve my makeup and to get my hands on everything in the drugstore bag, I concentrated heavily on my schoolwork, instead of biting my nails and worrying about what people thought of me. Over the next few weeks, I was thrilled to watch my nails grow. By the time I earned the certificate to have my hair cut and restyled, my nails were so long that my mother also treated me to a manicure while we were at the salon. And as time wore on, I began to see that I was getting through the rough spot, just as she had promised I would. I liked that I received so many compliments on my hands and hair, but more than that, I was proud of myself for sticking with the deal and improving myself in the process&#x2014;so proud, as a matter of fact, that I failed to notice my acne slowly clearing up. And I couldn't have cared less about what's-his-name. He quickly became a distant memory as I began to date many different boys, some of whom broke my heart and others whose hearts I broke.</p> <p>Though it certainly wasn't my last acne outbreak, bad hair day or crushed spirit, I did learn something. I will hold with me forever my mother's words of wisdom: "One day you'll look back on this and wonder why you were ever so upset."</p> <p>Years later, after several ups and downs in my life, I look back and realize that I did come through it all and I am the better for it. I only hope that if one day I have a daughter who is experiencing the struggles of adolescence, I will be as understanding, helpful and creative as my mother was with me.</p> <p><strong>-Laurie Lonsdale</strong></p></p><h2>Finding Your Spiritual Gifts Questionnaire: The Easy-to-Use, Self-Guided Questionnaire</h2><p><b>Bestselling Spiritual Gifts Inventory Updated and Expanded for New Generation<br><br></b>God has a purpose and plan for each of us--and he has given us the gifts and tools we need to fulfill them.

This time it is encouraging readers to choose the track that best suits their interests and talents and forge ahead on life's journey. Dorfman suggests that though there will be "deep river valleys" and "high mountaintops," dark tunnels and uncharted territory, "I think I can" should be their clarion cry. The rhyming text often does not scan and forced rhymes such as "toured"/"aboard" are sprinkled throughout. Ong's illustrations feature pastel colors and a train that looks very much like its forebear. Children and adults of different ethnic groups and genders greet it on its route. While this is a pleasant book with a much-needed message of confidence and perseverance, that message can only be understood by older children and adults. To pair it with illustrations that have a definitely "young" look makes for an uncomfortable fit. And this text breaks no ground that has not already been mined in Dr. Seuss's Oh, the Places You'll Go! (Random, 1990). Although "I think I can" has entered into the American lexicon and conjures up pleasant memories of the earlier book, this one is an additional purchase at best, especially if the Seuss book is on the shelf.<br><i>Marianne Saccardi, Norwalk Community College, CT</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>180 Days of Science: Grade 6 - Daily Science Workbook for Classroom and Home, Cool and Fun Interactive Practice, Elementary School Level Activities ...

After a year apart, and an ill-fated affair with the Winter Street Inn's old Santa Claus, Mitzi has returned to rule the roost; Patrick is about to be released from prison; Kevin has a successful new business and is finally ready to tie the knot with Isabelle; and best of all, there's hopeful news about Bart, who has been captured by enemy forces in Afghanistan. <br><br>That doesn't mean there aren't a few dark clouds on the horizon.

As in many familiar folktale themes, Fox and Crow are trying to outwit each other. In the first episode, Fox tricks Crow into dropping a chunk of cheese right into his mouth. Crow then uses cheese to lure Fox into a cleverly designed trap. But where does the cheese come from? The third chapter shows both tricksters recognizing their mistakes. "That will teach you not to steal my cheese," says Mama Bear, whose presence in the earlier chapters will be noted by astute observers of Braun's lively, colorful cartoon-style illustrations.

As a mom and psychologist, I have learned that it is ever so important that healthy coping skills are discussed and promoted for children at an early age. It was also important that I write a book with characters that reflected images of my children. In fact, my kids (ages 6, 4, and 2) helped develop this book by sharing their own cool ideas about the characters and ways they like to express and cope with fussy and frustrating feelings.

"The moment I saw you, / I fell in love, / Honey, my bunny, / my sweet turtledove. // Wiggling and giggling, / you captured my heart. / I loved you so much, dear, / right from the start." Love at first sight deepens as the pages turn, becoming that special relationship of mutual devotion unique to a grandmother and grandchild. While this displays no shortage of greeting-card syrup in its sentiment, its gentleness will make for nice initial read-aloud sessions for the intended audience and an appropriately thoughtful gift from any new grandma to grandchild (as blank lines for inscription, a "special letter" to the grandchild and a picture of grandmother and grandchild attest).<br>An unabashedly idealized but nevertheless wholehearted hymn to grandmotherhood&nbsp;<i>(Picture book. 2-4)"</i></p><h2>Night Night, Groot</h2><p>It&#39;s been a long day for baby Groot and he&#39;s ready to be tucked in for bed.

(25-pack)</h2><p><p>DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT JESUS CHRIST IS GOING TO COME BACK TO THIS EARTH AGAIN? I do. And I don&#x2019;t see any other hope for the world because we&#x2019;re heading toward a catastrophe.</p><p>The Bible says, &#x201c;Scoffers will come in the last days. . . . They will say, &#x2018;Where is the promise of his coming?&#x2019; For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God, and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished. But by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly&#x201d; (2 Peter 3:3&#x2013;7).</p><p>The Word of God, the Bible, speaks of the certainties of the end of the world. Jesus said, &#x201c;As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man&#x201d; (Matthew 24:37). What were the days of Noah like? And is there a parallel for today? The people of Noah&#x2019;s day were very wicked: &#x201c;Every intention of the thoughts&#x201d; of their hearts was &#x201c;only evil continually&#x201d; (Genesis 6:5). Marriage was abused, people were corrupt, violence prevailed (Genesis 6:1&#x2013;13). There was a lot of &#x201c;religion,&#x201d; but it was decadent. People were preoccupied with things and didn&#x2019;t have time for God.</p><p>So God warned them, &#x201c;Unless you repent and change your ways, you&#x2019;re going to face judgment.&#x201d; In the middle of all that corruption, Noah dared to live for God. Noah believed in God, and true faith determined how he lived. By that faith Noah built a ship in the middle of the desert, and he and his family were saved when the waters of destruction came (Genesis 6:1&#x2013;13, Hebrews 11:7). True faith should determine how we live, too.</p><p>Today the only bright spot on the horizon of this world&#x2019;s future is the promise of the return of Jesus Christ. We can&#x2019;t go on like this much longer, either morally or scientifically. The technology that was supposed to save us is ready to destroy us. Yet we&#x2019;re not to wait in terror, because as Christians, we have the hope of the return of Christ. When is he going to return? Jesus said,&nbsp;&#x201c;Concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only&#x201d; (Matthew 24:36).</p><p>NOAH BELIEVED IN GOD, AND TRUE FAITH DETERMINED HOW HE LIVED. TRUE FAITH SHOULD DETERMINE HOW WE LIVE, TOO.</p><p>But are you ready when the end of life in this world comes for you personally? The Bible says, &#x201c;It is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment&#x201d; (Hebrews 9:27). It is coming the moment you die, and that could be at any time for any of us. You may be expecting to live for many more years, but you can&#x2019;t know for sure. We never know. One of the biblical prophets wrote, &#x201c;Prepare to meet your God&#x201d; (Amos 4:12). What have you done spiritually in your life to prepare for that moment when your heart stops beating? The Bible also says about Jesus: &#x201c;There is salvation [from God&#x2019;s judgment for sin] in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved&#x201d; (Acts 4:12). You need to make a commitment to Christ today.</p><p>First, repent of your sins, including all of those things we say and do that offend other people, and God himself! &#x201c;All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&#x201d; (Romans 3:23). Without God&#x2019;s Spirit coming to live within us we don&#x2019;t have the strength to change and live a life that pleases God. That&#x2019;s why we need to be saved! Repentance means that you say to God, &#x201c;I have sinned. I am sorry for my sins. I want to change my way of living by your empowerment.&#x201d;</p><p>Second, you come to God by faith. That means that you put your whole trust in him and say, &#x201c;Lord, I believe Christ&#x2019;s death for me provides everything I need to be forgiven for my sins and become accepted by you. I trust in Jesus alone for my salvation. Please save me now and help me live for you.&#x201d;</p><p>You may be a good person. You may do all the good that you can think of, but all of that isn&#x2019;t enough. You must come in childlike faith to Jesus who died on the cross for you, who rose again, who is waiting for you to make that commitment.</p><p>ARE YOU READY TO MEET GOD?</p></p><p></p><h2>Upside-Down Magic (Upside-Down Magic #1)</h2><p>It's never easy when your magic goes wonky.<br><br>For Nory, this means that instead of being able to turn into a dragon or a kitten, she turns into both of them at the same time -- a dritten.<br><br>For Elliott, the simple act of conjuring fire from his fingertips turns into a fully frozen failure.<br><br>For Andres, wonky magic means he's always floating in the air, bouncing off the walls, or sitting on the ceiling.<br><br>For Bax, a bad moment of magic will turn him into a . . . actually, he'd rather not talk about that.<br><br>Nory, Elliott, Andres, and Bax are just four of the students in Dunwiddle Magic School's Upside-Down Magic class.

But once committed, he is determined to turn them around and to somehow right the wrongs of his own failed career. It&#39;s a bumpy ride but with pride, determination, and dignity, the bobsledders make their impossible dreams come true.|The filmmakers traveled to Jamaica for the primary filming and shot the Winter Olympics scenes in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.|The movie is based on a true story about the unlikely formation of a Jamaican bobsled team to compete in the 1988 Winter Olympics.

We talk around purpose. We encourage others to enter it. But so many of us don&#x2019;t truly, confidently know it for ourselves.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s okay. You&#x2019;re not alone. The majority of women on the planet&#x2014;Believers included&#x2014;don&#x2019;t know their purpose either. It&#x2019;s not popular for a Believer to confess that she loves God, and she trusts God, but she doesn&#x2019;t know why God sent her here, and she&#x2019;s not crystal clear as to what God wants her to do.<br> <br>But purpose is not supposed to be an ever-seeking, never-finding, illusive, impossible-to-grasp type of thing.<br><br>God wants you to know what your purpose is.<br><br>When we look at our lives, we see chaos. When God looks at our lives, He sees a map. He sees your beginning and your end, and all of Heaven (even right now) is constantly seeking to move you forward and closer to your divine destination.<br> <br>God is a God of impeccable order, intention, and structure. Nothing that has occurred in your life is a coincidence. Everything you&#x2019;ve encountered&#x2014;even the things that seemed awful&#x2014;has been part of your journey.<br> <br>And while you might intrinsically know that you&#x2019;re on some kind of a journey, you may not know exactly where you are, where you&#x2019;re going, and most importantly, why you&#x2019;re ultimately here. We&#x2019;re going to explore that together. I&#x2019;ll help you see that your life makes more sense than you realize.<br> <br>That your past or even present pain is not a penalty.<br> <br>That there are hidden patterns embedded in your experiences containing God&#x2019;s direction and ultimate intention for your life.<br> <br>Your purpose isn&#x2019;t lost. Purpose isn&#x2019;t even something you find. It&#x2019;s something you uncover. God already designed you for it and you&#x2019;re already being guided by it. It&#x2019;s what led you to this book. During our journey together, it is my prayer to help you embrace it and enter it. You are more important than you can possibly imagine and more gifted than your mind can conceive.<br><br>To live the life God intends, we must first put on God&#x2019;s lens.<br><br>Truth is&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you&#x2019;ve created an outdated life and identity for yourself. It&#x2019;s probably focused on achieving success or comfort, or just avoiding conflict and failure. Your life, the way you know it right now, gives you a certain level of confidence, predictability, and let&#x2019;s be honest&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. control.<br> <br>But deep within, you know there is an unlived life waiting for you. One with only your name on it. One God has destined you for all along.<br> <br>You may not be able to fully see it, but you can sense it.<br> <br>It calls to you.<br> <br>You begin to thirst for it. A life of relevance. Substance. Confidence. Clarity. Impact. Beauty and elegance. A life soaked in divine significance.<br> <br>The simple secret to awakening your purpose is to understand how purpose works. Your life, you see, is a map made up of five key life stages. God intends for you to advance through each stage in order to enter your true purpose and fulfill your life mission. However, many of us are stuck in one of the five stages and don&#x2019;t even know it. I didn&#x2019;t. Over time, I discovered not only how to advance through the stages, but what God had been calling me to all along. In this book, I am going to share what I learned about God&#x2019;s peculiar path of divine reinvention so you can find your God-given purpose, too.<br> <br>I will help you understand your ultimate calling and show you the path (and beliefs necessary) to get there. But before you proceed further, be forewarned.<br><br>Entering your purpose will first require an exit.<br><br>To unleash the greater you, God will disrupt you and dismantle you.<br> <br>He will humble you. He will use any means necessary to get your attention. He will even break you so He can rebuild you anew. To fulfill your true life mission, you will have to unlearn who you have been, and muster the courage to discover who you really are, what you possess, and how God designed you.<br> <br>In the pages that follow, you&#x2019;ll see how purpose is often embedded in the middle of your mess. Frustration, betrayal, disappointment, health scares, sudden loss, career changes, and seasons of unexpected disruption and transition may be linked to the master mission God has you here to complete. I&#x2019;m inviting you right now to look at purpose in a fresh new way.<br> <br>My intention is that as you turn each page in this book, you&#x2019;ll gain the confidence and clarity needed to be who God has already called you to be, and do what He has already designed you to do.</p><h2>Creative Haven Spring Scenes Coloring Book (Creative Haven Coloring Books)</h2><p><p>Let your creativity spring to life with 31 illustrations that celebrate the most colorful season of the year.

Whether my husband and I have faced good times or really difficult trials, prayer has brought us closer to each other in our marriage and closer to God. And when we were extremely broken, ready to give up altogether, God heard our prayers and He saved us! <b><i>He saved our marriage!</i></b><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>Prayer is beautiful. Just having intimate access to talk to God and knowing He desires to hear from us is pretty incredible. Then as we specifically pray for marriage, it aligns our hearts with His will. To go even further, when we pray with our spouse, they get to hear what we say which is usually a glimpse into the depths of our hearts. In all the years my husband and I have prayed together I can attest that it is remarkably affirming.&nbsp;Prayer is vital. Submitting to God through prayer is something that I do because it changes my heart and my outlook on life for the better. Without prayer, I would have no hope of help. I would feel completely isolated and alone in my most personal struggles. Prayer is an anchor of hope in my life!&nbsp;<i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with&nbsp;</i><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which&nbsp;</i><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus."&nbsp;</i><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&nbsp;</i><i>Philippians 4:6-7</i><i>&nbsp;</i>My husband and I are advocates for couples praying together, praying for their marriage. When we are encouraging other husbands and wives we stress the importance of prayer. Why? Because the power of prayer transformed us and we want others to experience it! We also decided to write resources that will help teach and challenge a husband and wife pray for each other. We also did this because of the response/need we heard from people expressing how hard prayer can be or that they didn't know where to start.&nbsp;Thirty-One Prayers For My Husband Was written to help wives pray specifically for different areas of life for their husband. I chose 31-prayers to make sure that every day of the month is covered!&nbsp;We also added blank pages after each prayer for people to make these prayers more personal.&nbsp;<b>Some of the prayers include:</b> * Leader Of The Home * Pursuing Gentleness * Freedom From Lust * Knowing His Purpose * Integrity * Extraordinary Marriage&nbsp;My challenge to you is to commit to praying for your marriage on a daily basis. Start with one month, 31 days, and challenge yourself to pray for your spouse.&nbsp;My heart is to encourage you to be praying for your marriage on a daily basis. Prayer is so significant and I know God wants to hear from us.&nbsp;<i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,</i><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and he delivered them from their distress.</i><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He made the storm be still,</i><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;and the waves of the sea were hushed.</i><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then they were glad that the waters were quiet,</i><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and he brought them to their desired haven."</i><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Psalm 107:28-30</i></p><p><b><i>Prayer is the gift God gave us to be able to have direct access to His throne room to communicate with Him.&nbsp;</i></b><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>This book of 31 marriage prayers is purposed to encourage and guide you as you pray for specific aspects of your husband's life and character. My hope is that this marriage resource motivates you to intentionally pray and petition for your husband and your marriage on a daily basis through the power of prayer. There is even free writing space for you to add your own thoughts and prayers to each marriage prayer, to make them your own, and to lift up specific prayer requests your husband may have.&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge you to consider the importance of being a wife of faithful prayer, to commit to praying for your husband and marriage daily, and watch God move in both your hearts!

Ramos, Jr., and illustrator Germï¿½n Blanco, <i>When Pencil Met Eraser </i>brings to life something kids use every day at school and at home. Engaging art, adorable characters, and a clever ending create a memorable message about friendship and creativity.</p><p><b>An Imprint Book</b></p><p><b>"</b>An imaginative and engaging look into artistic possibility." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><i></i><br><i></i><b>&#x201c;</b>Readers young and old alike will love this imagining of the dynamic duo that is Pencil and Eraser.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>School Library Journal</i></p></p><p><p><b>Karen Kilpatrick</b> has been telling and writing stories for as long as she can remember. A former attorney who left the legal industry for the toy industry, she is also the author of the Pumpkinheads children's book series and cocreator with her two daughters of the toy brand, MeBears. She lives in South Florida with her three kids.</p><p><b>Luis Osvaldo Ramos, Jr.</b> was born and raised in Tampa, Florida, and graduated from University of Central Florida and University of Miami Law. He's an attorney at law and a kid at heart who practices law during the day and writes and consumes stories in his free time. He and his wife currently live in South Florida with their very cute but very demanding orange cat.</p><p><b>Germï¿½n Blanco</b> has been using pencils all his life. Erasers, too. He unknowingly began his artistic career as a kid by doodling in school whenever he was bored. (Sorry, Mom!) He later became a graphic designer but he found his passion in illustration. When he&#x2019;s not drawing, he enjoys watching movies and playing football (AKA soccer).</p>K-Gr 2-Pencil and Eraser may be inseparable now, but that was not always the case. From the beginning of the story, Pencil is obsessed with drawing and loves working alone. Enter Eraser: a happy-go-lucky companion who sees Pencil's drawings and does what Eraser does best: erase! While Eraser believes that the select removal of some of Pencil's work makes the picture better, Pencil does not agree. Their disagreements continue until one day, Pencil, like everyone does at one point or another, makes a mistake. This mistake makes Pencil realize the potential of Eraser, and it changes the course of the book. A silly, relatable story about friendship and the importance of collaboration, readers young and old alike will love this imagining of the dynamic duo that is Pencil and Eraser. Using a blend of pencil drawings and computer generated imagery, every page provides delightful stimulation both for one-on-one readers and for larger audiences. Each character has a unique font and, due to the nature of charcoal on paper, the characters are the only parts of the page in color.

He was an old man, past fifty, and he had seen the lordlings come and go. &#x201c;Dead is dead,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We have no business with the dead.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Are they dead?&#x201d; Royce asked softly. &#x201c;What proof have we?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Will saw them,&#x201d; Gared said. &#x201c;If he says they are dead, that&#x2019;s proof enough for me.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Will had known they would drag him into the quarrel sooner or later. He wished it had been later rather than sooner. &#x201c;My mother told me that dead men sing no songs,&#x201d; he put in.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,&#x201d; Royce replied. &#x201c;Never believe anything you hear at a woman&#x2019;s tit. There are things to be learned even from the dead.&#x201d; His voice echoed, too loud in the twilit forest.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have a long ride before us,&#x201d; Gared pointed out. &#x201c;Eight days, maybe nine. And night is falling.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ser Waymar Royce glanced at the sky with disinterest. &#x201c;It does that every day about this time. Are you unmanned by the dark, Gared?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Will could see the tightness around Gared&#x2019;s mouth, the barely suppressed anger in his eyes under the thick black hood of his cloak. Gared had spent forty years in the Night&#x2019;s Watch, man and boy, and he was not accustomed to being made light of. Yet it was more than that. Under the wounded pride, Will could sense something else in the older man. You could taste it; a nervous tension that came perilous close to fear.<br> &nbsp;<br> Will shared his unease. He had been four years on the Wall. The first time he had been sent beyond, all the old stories had come rushing back, and his bowels had turned to water. He had laughed about it afterward. He was a veteran of a hundred rangings by now, and the endless dark wilderness that the southron called the haunted forest had no more terrors for him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Until tonight. Something was different tonight. There was an edge to this darkness that made his hackles rise. Nine days they had been riding, north and northwest and then north again, farther and farther from the Wall, hard on the track of a band of Wildling raiders. Each day had been worse than the day that had come before it. Today was the worst of all. A cold wind was blowing out of the north, and it made the trees rustle like living things. All day, Will had felt as though something were watching him, something cold and implacable that loved him not. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted nothing so much as to ride hellbent for the safety of the Wall, but that was not a feeling to share with your commander.<br> &nbsp;<br> Especially not a commander like this one.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ser Waymar Royce was the youngest son of an ancient house with too many heirs. He was a handsome youth of eighteen, grey-eyed and graceful and slender as a knife. Mounted on his huge black destrier, the knight towered above Will and Gared on their smaller garrons. He wore black leather boots, black woolen pants, black moleskin gloves, and a fine supple coat of gleaming black ringmail over layers of black wool and boiled leather. Ser Waymar had been a Sworn Brother of the Night&#x2019;s Watch for less than half a year, but no one could say he had not prepared for his vocation. At least insofar as his wardrobe was concerned.<br> &nbsp;<br> His cloak was his crowning glory; sable, thick and black and soft as sin. &#x201c;Bet he killed them all himself, he did,&#x201d; Gared told the barracks over wine, &#x201c;twisted their little heads off, our mighty warrior.&#x201d; They had all shared the laugh.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is hard to take orders from a man you laughed at in your cups, Will reflected as he sat shivering atop his garron. Gared must have felt the same.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Mormont said as we should track them, and we did,&#x201d; Gared said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re dead. They shan&#x2019;t trouble us no more. There&#x2019;s hard riding before us. I don&#x2019;t like this weather. If it snows, we could be a fortnight getting back, and snow&#x2019;s the best we can hope for. Ever seen an ice storm, my lord?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The lordling seemed not to hear him. He studied the deepening twilight in that half-bored, half-distracted way he had. Will had ridden with the knight long enough to understand that it was best not to interrupt him when he looked like that. &#x201c;Tell me again what you saw, Will. All the details. Leave nothing out.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Will had been a hunter before he joined the Night&#x2019;s Watch. Well, a poacher in truth. Mallister freeriders had caught him red-handed in the Mallisters&#x2019; own woods, skinning one of the Mallisters&#x2019; own bucks, and it had been a choice of putting on the black or losing a hand. No one could move through the woods as silent as Will, and it had not taken the black brothers long to discover his talent.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The camp is two miles farther on, over that ridge, hard beside a stream,&#x201d; Will said. &#x201c;I got close as I dared. There&#x2019;s eight of them, men and women both. No children I could see. They put up a lean-to against the rock. The snow&#x2019;s pretty well covered it now, but I could still make it out. No fire burning, but the firepit was still plain as day. No one moving. I watched a long time. No living man ever lay so still.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you see any blood?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, no,&#x201d; Will admitted.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you see any weapons?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Some swords, a few bows. One man had an axe. Heavy-looking, double-bladed, a cruel piece of iron. It was on the ground beside him, right by his hand.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did you make note of the position of the bodies?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Will shrugged. &#x201c;A couple are sitting up against the rock. Most of them on the ground. Fallen, like.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Or sleeping,&#x201d; Royce suggested.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Fallen,&#x201d; Will insisted. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s one woman up an ironwood, half-hid in the branches. A far-eyes.&#x201d; He smiled thinly. &#x201c;I took care she never saw me. When I got closer, I saw that she wasn&#x2019;t moving neither.&#x201d; Despite himself, he shivered.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You have a chill?&#x201d; Royce asked.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Some,&#x201d; Will muttered. &#x201c;The wind, m&#x2019;lord.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> The young knight turned back to his grizzled man-at-arms. Frost-fallen leaves whispered past them, and Royce&#x2019;s destrier moved restlessly. &#x201c;What do you think might have killed these men, Gared?&#x201d; Ser Waymar asked casually. He adjusted the drape of his long sable cloak.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It was the cold,&#x201d; Gared said with iron certainty. &#x201c;I saw men freeze last winter, and the one before, when I was half a boy. Everyone talks about snows forty foot deep, and how the ice wind comes howling out of the north, but the real enemy is the cold. It steals up on you quieter than Will, and at first you shiver and your teeth chatter and you stamp your feet and dream of mulled wine and nice hot fires. It burns, it does. Nothing burns like the cold. But only for a while. Then it gets inside you and starts to fill you up, and after a while you don&#x2019;t have the strength to fight it. It&#x2019;s easier just to sit down or go to sleep. They say you don&#x2019;t feel any pain toward the end. First you go weak and drowsy, and everything starts to fade, and then it&#x2019;s like sinking into a sea of warm milk. Peaceful, like.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Such eloquence, Gared,&#x201d; Ser Waymar observed. &#x201c;I never suspected you had it in you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had the cold in me too, lordling.&#x201d; Gared pulled back his hood, giving Ser Waymar a good long look at the stumps where his ears had been. &#x201c;Two ears, three toes, and the little finger off my left hand. I got off light. We found my brother frozen at his watch, with a smile on his face.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Ser Waymar shrugged. &#x201c;You ought dress more warmly, Gared.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Gared glared at the lordling, the scars around his ear holes flushed red with anger where Maester Aemon had cut the ears away. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see how warm you can dress when the winter comes.&#x201d; He pulled up his hood and hunched over his garron, silent and sullen.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;If Gared said it was the cold&nbsp;...&#x201d; Will began.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Have you drawn any watches this past week, Will?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, m&#x2019;lord.&#x201d; There never was a week when he did not draw a dozen bloody watches. What was the man driving at?<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And how did you find the Wall?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Weeping,&#x201d; Will said, frowning. He saw it clear enough, now that the lordling had pointed it out. &#x201c;They couldn&#x2019;t have froze. Not if the Wall was weeping. It wasn&#x2019;t cold enough.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Royce nodded. &#x201c;Bright lad. We&#x2019;ve had a few light frosts this past week, and a quick flurry of snow now and then, but surely no cold fierce enough to kill eight grown men. Men clad in fur and leather, let me remind you, with shelter near at hand, and the means of making fire.&#x201d; The knight&#x2019;s smile was cocksure. &#x201c;Will, lead us there. I would see these dead men for myself.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And then there was nothing to be done for it. The order had been given, and honor bound them to obey.<br> &nbsp;<br> Will went in front, his shaggy little garron picking the way carefully through the undergrowth. A light snow had fallen the night before, and there were stones and roots and hidden sinks lying just under its crust, waiting for the careless and the unwary. Ser Waymar Royce came next, his great black destrier snorting impatiently. The warhorse was the wrong mount for ranging, but try and tell that to the lordling. Gared brought up the rear. The old man-at-arms muttered to himself as he rode.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Eyelike Stickers: Horses</h2><p><p>Guaranteed to bring unbridled joy to every kid and crafter who loves horses, <i>Eyelike Stickers: Horses</i> is the newest addition to the bestselling sticker book series that has over a million copies in print.

It shows the proven formula of Mick Grant, who produced Hershey&#39;s North American Final qualifiers 12 consecutive years, multiple Footlocker Finalists and National Champions several years in a row, including Hershey&#39;s North American Final, USATF Junior Olympics, USATF Youth Athletics Nationals and National Scholastic Indoor Championships. All this from a group of ordinary local kids, near Mick&#39;s home in Northeast Massachusetts. The book lays out in detail how youth and teen athletes can achieve successively higher levels, year after year after year, following the proven success of Mick&#39;s training program. What differentiates this program and this book from other programs and books is that it is a unique blend of building endurance and improving basic speed throughout the year, so that the athlete is much better next year than they are this year. The program uses a FUN FIRST approach, making sure the athletes enjoy what they are doing and stay healthy, to allow consistent training. It is the first such book to cover every topic imaginable for the youth and teen middle to long distance runner, jammed packed with almost 200 pages of vital information. This book is a must read for all youth runners age 6 to 18, and anyone helping youth runners starting on the way to a lifelong enjoyment of running, and a successful running career.

The results he has gotten are nothing short of remarkable including National Champions six consecutive years and having qualified athletes for the Olympic Trials, Hershey National Championships 12 years in a row. Several of his runners have gone on to become State and National high school champions including Russell Brown, who went on to run a 3:51 mile and Chantelle Dron, who ran a 4:22 1500 meter run at age 15.

Failure, rejection, sickness, losing a loved one, being alone&#x2014;the fears we carry are many and heavy. Fear can be a tyrant, a bully we can&#x2019;t hide from. It can paralyze our spirit, damage our relationships, and hinder our faith.</p><p>Trillia is no stranger to fear.

Did any of this book come from your own childhood? / How did the idea for Henry and his toy rabbit Raspberry come about?</strong></p> <p>Skye: The story of <i>The Power of Henry&#x2019;s Imagination</i> definitely came from my own experiences. I seem to be someone who loses things kind of easily. As an adult, I have lost some of the most precious things one can lose &#x2013; my wallet, my journal, my dog. Each time I would visualize that I had them back, believe I would get them back, and they always returned to me (through some truly incredible sequences of events). But as a child I didn&#x2019;t know to visualize when I lost a favorite toy, and I wish I had known, because I was always misplacing them! </p> <p>Nic: In creating the artwork for <i>The Power of Henry&#x2019;s Imagination</i>, I referenced many of my own memories of &#x2018;place&#x2019; from my childhood. Most notably, the tree where we find Henry and Raspberry settled on the front cover, in the opening of the book, as well as when Henry &#x201c;begins to use his imagination.&#x201d; My childhood home had a tree just like it, where my brother and I nailed planks of wood to form a ladder to get to a comfortable branch; perfect for imagining. </p> <p>Now that I think about it, I believe the character design for Raspberry the rabbit may have been subconsciously influenced by the hare-like features of a childhood favorite, Bugs Bunny. </p> <p><strong>2. Did you have a favorite stuffed animal friend like Raspberry when you were little?</strong></p> <p>Skye: Like Henry, I was given a very special friend the day I was born. Mine was not a rabbit, but a sheepskin blanket that I called Sheppy. Just like Henry does with Raspberry, I took Sheppy absolutely everywhere with me, and I was always misplacing him. When I was without him I was miserable, and couldn&#x2019;t think of anything else until I found him. I still carry small, subtle pieces of Sheppy around with me to this day &#x2013; and I&#x2019;m 32 years old! </p> <p>Nic: My favorite stuffed animal friend as a child was a monkey named Bozo. I don't remember giving Bozo his name, but I remember his character to be very amenable; he was always where I left him. </p> <p><strong>3. What was the collaborative process like between the two of you, since you&#x2019;ve known each other since you were both eight years old?</strong></p> <p>Skye: Working with Nic on this book was like working with myself; we almost always see everything the same way. I actually can&#x2019;t think of a single contentious moment. We are best friends who have known each other all our lives and experienced some really big things together, like moving to another country, and now, creating a book together! I think we&#x2019;re an amazing team.</p> <p>Nic: I can&#x2019;t speak highly enough about Skye as a person. We are best friends. We&#x2019;re generally always thinking or feeling the same thing with regard to creative decisions, and when we aren&#x2019;t, there is a great deal of trust that can be called upon, because of the long friendship we&#x2019;ve had. Though we focus on different skill sets (Skye writes and I make pictures), we are able to interpret each other&#x2019;s work with appreciation as well as a critical mind. I think we have a genuine desire to hear each other&#x2019;s feedback, and there&#x2019;s no greater complement than your collaborator&#x2019;s approval of your work! </p> <p><strong>4. Have you always wanted to write and draw for children?</strong></p> <p>Skye: I have wanted to write since I learned how to write, and learned that writing was something one could do. I always thought I would end up writing novels for adults, and yet it doesn&#x2019;t at all surprise me that I&#x2019;ve ended up writing for children; I still feel like a child, and childhood remains for me the most beautiful time of a person&#x2019;s life.</p> <p>Nic: I think I have always wanted to draw and create for people. Considering children as a particular audience became an interest, surprisingly, when I was 20 years of age. I think this had to do with my connection with Skye, and our remembrance of knowing each other in childhood. It was fascinating to reflect on childhood experiences as grown-ups (with Skye). There is a profound intelligence expressed in children, amidst all the strangeness of &#x2018;growing up,&#x2019; that is very interesting to me. I like the challenge of creating in a way that hopefully appeals to both children and adults alike. </p> <p><strong>5. Did you write books when you were kids?</strong></p> <p>Skye: When I learned how to write at age 7, I couldn&#x2019;t stop writing. My teacher at the time, Mrs Dyte, would bind every single story I wrote into a little book and write encouraging comments in the back of each one. I had dozens and dozens of them by the end of that year. I always remember Mrs Dyte as the first person who saw me as a writer and helped me to believe I could be one.</p> <p>Nic: My Mum just recently sent me a photo of a book I wrote as a young child. The first page read: &#x201c;Once there was a dinosaur. It was called Tyrannosaurus Rex.&#x201d;</p> <p>I also remember writing a book called &#x201c;The Three Bears in Space,&#x201d; a reworking of Goldilocks and the Three Bears. After writing it, I employed my Dad to illustrate it. My Father was a naturally very gifted artist. I watched him draw each of the pictures with amazement and wonder, after explaining what should be drawn on each page. I&#x2019;ve been making up stories and telling them in some form&#x2014;writing, drawing, or acting&#x2014;since I&#x2019;ve known how.</p> <p><strong>6. What children&#x2019;s books did you grow up with?/ What are your favorites?</strong></p> <p>Skye: I spent most of my childhood first being read to, and later reading myself. I think books formed and influenced my world and the way I saw the world more than anything else, and there were so many favorites. A very few of them were: Night Noises by Mem Fox, Animalia and The Eleventh Hour by Graeme Base, I&#x2019;ll Always Love You by Hans Wilhelm, Martha B. Rabbit by Shirley Barber, Where the Forest Meets the Sea by Jeannie Baker, Once There Were Giants by Martin Waddell, The Long Red Scarf by Nette Hilton, Good Dog Carl by Alexandra Day, The Polar Express by Chris Van Allsburg, and everything by Enid Blyton and Roald Dahl.</p> <p>Nic: Books I grew up with include: The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter, all of the Dr. Seuss books, Animalia, The Eleventh Hour, and The Sign of The Seahorse by Graeme Base; and Possum Magic by Mem Fox and Julie Vivas.</p> <p>My favorites were: Hubert's Hair Raising Adventure by Bill Peet, The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle, Where the Forest Meets the Sea by Jeannie Baker, everything by Roald Dahl with illustrations by Quentin Blake, The Rainbow Serpent by Dick Roughsey, and my all time favorites by Maurice Sendak, Where The Wild Things Are, and In the Night Kitchen. Sendak&#x2019;s imagination certainly influenced mine when making <i>The Power of Henry&#x2019;s Imagination</i>. There&#x2019;s a nod to Sendak&#x2019;s <i>In the Night Kitchen</i> with the Henry and Raspberry &#x201c;count all the stars in the universe,&#x201d; scene in the book. </p> <p><strong>7. Nic, can you talk a little bit about the play with mixed mediums, like leaves, ribbons, clothespins that you incorporate into your drawings?</strong></p> <p>Nic: I felt very fortunate to use a combination of photography and drawing for this book. I gained a lot of confidence to begin this project when our Creative Director, Dan Potash, commented on my photographic work creating a &#x2018;strong sense of place.&#x2019; I really drew upon this idea of creating &#x2018;place,&#x2019; with the addition of real objects for the compositions in the book. I really like the play between the reality of the objects and the concept of imagination. This may be a little introspective, but for me, I feel it asks the reader to engage with their own imaginative mind; to consider how we perceive the function and nature of &#x2018;things.&#x2019; Salt crystals crafted into the shape of a mountain and cave, reads as a glacial, snow capped environment, and yet the reality is, it&#x2019;s just salt on some kraft paper with a little ink drawing of a boy and a rabbit cooking beans! I also like the emotional quality created by some of the placement of objects. The ribbon, in the &#x201c;bedroom upside down&#x201d; spread, gave this great lyrical expression, almost becoming an empathetic character within the story, attempting in its ribbony way to comfort Henry, as he &#x201c;starts to feel worried.&#x201d; I hope that some of these subtleties are enjoyed by readers. </p> <p><strong>8. What is your favorite part of the book?</strong></p> <p>Skye: My favorite part of the book is at the very end, when Henry is smiling in his sleep and Grandpa has come into the bedroom and tucked Raspberry into bed with him. I can just imagine the joy Henry will feel when he wakes up to find his friend in his arms.</p> <p>Nic: I love the part of the book where Henry begins to imagine. I love the anticipation created with the words, &#x201c;And so Henry began to imagine...&#x201d;. I can really feel how parents, on their second reading of the book, will add a little performance to the delivery of these words, knowing the excitement coming on the following pages. I also love the quality of light and visual simplicity in this very important moment; it&#x2019;s kind of a moment of contemplation or meditation. This scene takes place in the middle of the story, as well as in the middle of the physical book. It is the bridge between the established &#x2018;real world&#x2019; and the &#x2018;interior world&#x2019; of Henry&#x2019;s imagination. </p> <p><strong>9. Do you have any plans on working on another book together?</strong></p> <p>Skye: Absolutely we do. Nic and I have found something that we really, really love to do, and we hope to keep making children&#x2019;s books for a long time to come.</p> <p>Nic: I can&#x2019;t wait to work on another book with Skye, and I hope we make many great books together as long as we both can. Doing this work came very naturally to both of us, and it feels right to follow this, especially if children and grown-ups respond well to it.</p> <p><strong>10. How does <i>The Power of Henry&#x2019;s Imagination</i> fit into The Secret?</strong></p> <p>Skye: Looking at it from a &#x201c;Secret&#x201d; perspective, <i>The Power of Henry&#x2019;s Imagination</i> is about visualization, one of the key concepts and practices of law of attraction. After losing Raspberry, Henry visualizes himself with his lost toy, which changes his whole emotional state and clears the path for Raspberry to return to him. It&#x2019;s not magic (the mailman simply finds Raspberry lying on the foot path and returns him to Grandpa), but it sure feels like magic when it happens to you. It&#x2019;s a very powerful experience to realize that your mind is interacting with the world and influencing what happens.</p> <p>Nic: I think it is very easy, as adults, to forget about the human mind&#x2019;s amazing faculty to imagine. We often associate this state of being with mere daydreaming, or indulgence in fantasy. But really concentrated imagination can be one of the most enriching experiences an individual can have. Deliberate use of imagination can create incredible things in the world. I like that this book looks at the concept of the creative thinking and human imagination, but it also demonstrates that sometimes &#x2018;letting go,&#x2019; trusting, and believing that you have everything you need in the moment, can shift your emotional state to a better place. Feeling good and feeling comfort in the world is something we should all have access too. </p>Skye Byrne was born in Australia and studied Professional Writing before she joined The Secret.

In vain we turn over the pages of the sacred Canon; not even in the Apocrypha can we trace one line from the pen of the marvellous being to whom uninterrupted immortality is assigned by apostolic interpretation of Genesis v. 24. Were the prophecies of Enoch, therefore, accepted as a Divine revelation on that momentous day when Jesus explained the Scriptures, after his resurrection, to Jude and his apostolic brethren; and have we moderns betrayed our trust by excluding an inspired record from the Bible?</p><p>He was British and is dead.Text: English (translation)</p><h2>Psychic Reiki: Divine Life-Force Energy Healing</h2><p><i>Psychic Reiki</i> is the culminating work of Bevell&#x2019;s previous books about Reiki, plus some new techniques, combined into one elegant and user-friendly energy healing system.

So Chato and his best friend, Novio Boy, get out the pots and pans, the tortillas and the beans--everything you'd need for a welcoming feast, except for the main dish, and the guests of honor.

You get the idea. Chato is a sly, mustachioed "cool cat" from an East Los Angeles barrio. The tiny feet? Those belong to the new mice (<i>ratoncitos</i>) next door--"five mice the color of gray river rock," to be precise. Chato promptly invites them over for dinner, in exactly the sense you might fear. <p> "That Chato cat seems muy simpatico, very nice, I'm sure," says Papi mouse.

She prepared to leave again but, God knew the seven people who said, &#34;We need to talk when you return&#34; would become another extension of time! Deeper roots were immediately revealed which contain the deeper truth. When she prayed God said, &#34;A simple title would be: For the Sake of America II.&#34; The LORD already confirmed He sent her to Georgia because she asked for the assignment. Since Georgia was not part of her conversations with the LORD she was a bit surprised until He reminded her of her own words each time she witnessed the flow of the body of Christ in other nations He sent her to around the world. She hoped the LORD would send someone to bring the truth to the body of Christ in America. When the LORD reminded her of her heart&#39;s desire, she realized in that moment He sent her to Georgia to be available during this critical time in our nation for His purpose, plan and promise to be made known to the people. The LORD promised the prophets and Sheila if His people who are called by His name will stand in faith, humble themselves, repent for what He reveals to the body of Christ from Macon, Georgia to Moravian Falls, North Carolina then His truth will restore the people in Georgia and across America like a mighty flood.</p><p></p><h2>SQL Antipatterns: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Programming (Pragmatic Programmers)</h2><p>Bill Karwin has helped thousands of people write better SQL and build stronger relational databases. Now he&#x2019;s sharing his collection of antipatterns&#x2014;the most common errors he&#x2019;s identified in those thousands of requests for help. Each chapter in this book helps you identify, explain, and correct a unique and dangerous antipattern. The four parts of the book group the antipatterns in terms of logical database design, physical database design, queries, and application development. The chances are good that your application&#x2019;s database layer already contains problems such as Index Shotgun, Keyless Entry, Fear of the Unknown, and Spaghetti Query. This book will help you and your team find them. Even better, it will also show you how to fix them, and how to avoid these and other problems in the future. SQL Antipatterns gives you a rare glimpse into an SQL expert&#x2019;s playbook. Now you can stamp out these common database errors once and for all. Whatever platform or programming language you use, whether you&#x2019;re a junior programmer or a Ph.D., SQL Antipatterns will show you how to design and build databases, how to write better database queries, and how to integrate SQL programming with your application like an expert. You&#x2019;ll also learn the best and most current technology for full-text search, how to design code that is resistant to SQL injection attacks, and other techniques for success. Most developers aren&#x2019;t SQL experts, and most of the SQL that gets used is inefficient, hard to maintain, and sometimes just plain wrong. This book shows you all the common mistakes, and then leads you through the best fixes. What&#x2019;s more, it shows you what&#x2019;s behind these fixes, so you&#x2019;ll learn a lot about relational databases along the way.</p><p><p>Bill Karwin has been a software engineer for over twenty years, developing and supporting applications, libraries, and servers such as Zend Framework for PHP 5, the InterBase relational database, and the Enhydra Java application server. Throughout his career, Bill has shared his knowledge to help other programmers achieve success and productivity. Bill has answered thousands of questions, giving him a unique perspective on SQL mistakes that most commonly cause problems.</p><p>""This book is obviously the product of many years of practical experience with SQL databases. Each topic is covered in great depth, and the attention to detail in the book was beyond my expectations. Although it's not a beginner's book, any developer with a reasonable amount of SQL experience should find it to be a valuable reference and would be hard-pressed not to learn something new.""--Mike Naberezny, Partner at Maintainable Software; Coauthor of "Rails for PHP Developers"<br><br></p><p>""Bill has written an engaging, useful, important, and unique book.

And that's a good thing.<br><br> The Christian culture that has underpinned Western society for centuries has been eroded. We're now at the point where to disagree with people on issues such as marriage and sexuality, is seen as hateful. Christians are no longer seen as honorable, but as bigots. But history testifies that the more people try to destroy Christianity, the more it grows. So we are entering an exciting period of time because we're back in the place where Christ's church can thrive - at the margins of society.<br><br> In this stirring, passionate book, Matt Chandler shows us we need Christian courage like never before, and how to live with compassion and conviction, able to look around positively and reach out confidently. <br><br> It encourages us not to be thwarted by fear, but to depend on God and have confidence that Christ will build his church, despite continual marginalization. A must-read for any Christian who wants to understand how to stand firm and walk forwards in an increasingly secular culture.</p><p>Matt Chandler is the Pastor of The Village Church in Flower Mound, Texas.

If that sounds like you, Matt Chandler has a word to speak: it's a great time to be a Christian; be courageous; take heart. If that sounds hollow and naï¿½ve, you need to read this book. Matt is keenly in touch with the troubles we face but even more so with the Lord of the universe, who ultimately wins. What he advocates isn't a fleshly triumphalism but a courageous faith in a really big God. <i>Take Heart</i> speaks a hopeful and thoroughly biblical word that all of us need to hear. Highly recommended!<br> --<b>Sam Storms</b>, Lead Pastor, Bridgeway Church, Oklahoma City; President of the Evangelical Theological Society<br><br> Do not be dismayed, for this is not the first time the very heart of God's plan for his people and his world has been questioned, assaulted, and pushed to the margins. This is the central message of this timely book by my dear brother Matt. Yet there is more. Within these pages you will be challenged to think critically about where your hope is actually invested, how you view the church's role with respect to the state, and if you indeed love you neighbor as yourself. Take heart: you are alive in an age ripe with opportunity and you can actually be integral to changing the world!<br> --<b>Leonce B. Crump Jr.</b>, Founding Pastor, Renovation Church, Atlanta; author of <i>Renovate: Changing Who You Are by Loving Where You Are</i><br><br> What a wonderful, inspiring work! In a time where Christianity is said to be losing ground in the culture, our impulse may be to panic. But what if this were actually our most opportune moment to experience renewal, and to become the kind of life-giving, world-changing disciples Jesus has always intended for us to be? In characteristic fashion, Matt has done a terrific job of laying out such a vision. In so doing, he has gotten me excited about the many things God still wants to do in the world, and the part we can all play in his plan.<br> --<b>Scott Sauls</b>, Senior Pastor, Christ Presbyterian Church, Nasvhille; author of <i>Jesus Outside the Lines, Befriend,</i> and <i>From Weakness to Strength</i><br><br> Fearing, agonizing, retreating, embracing. These are a few of the responses we see and might be experiencing in a 'post-Christian' culture. Chandler knows how many of us feel in our current cultural moment in the West. Through biblical truth, Chandler helps redirect our eyes to the One who can strengthen and encourage us so we might have courage.<br> --<b>Trillia Newbell</b>, Author of <i>God's Very Good Idea</i> and <i>Enjoy</i><br><br> This is a deeply encouraging book. I mean that literally: it brings courage to the reader. It is also enjoyably punchy, readably short, practically wise and pastorally insightful, with a warmth and winsomeness that books on this subject sometimes lack.

Instead, Lent is an invitation back to ourselves, back to the ground of our being as image-bearers, created "very good" even in our creaturely limitations. We are "enough" precisely because we're God-breathed and God-imaged. And even when we sabotage our original goodness, hiding behind our fig-leaved and false-selved control strategies, God pursues us in Jesus, becoming human not to overcome humanness but to redeem and ennoble it. These reflections - whether they are used for Lent or for another season of your life - are designed to invite you into the goodness of your life in Christ. Each week offers a unique theme that serves as a challenge for growth during Lent: RETURN TO YOUR GROUND WEEK 1 &#x2013; DWELL WITH GOD WEEK 2 &#x2013; LIVE FROM YOUR TRUE SELF WEEK 3 &#x2013; IMAGINE THE KINGDOM WEEK 4 &#x2013; TAKE THE HUMBLE PATH WEEK 5 &#x2013; WRESTLE WITH GOD WEEK 6 &#x2013; FOLLOW JESUS. Whether they are used for Lent or in another season, these reflections will invite you into deeper union and communion with the One who is "more near to you than you are to yourselves" (Augustine).</p><p>Chuck has been married to Sara with 20+ years and has two teenage daughters, Emma and Maggie.

The winner of four James Beard Awards, co-owner and chef of a world-renowned restaurant, and recipient of countless Michelin stars, Ripert embodies elegance and culinary perfection. But before the accolades, before he even knew how to make a proper hollandaise sauce, Eric Ripert was a lonely young boy in the south of France whose life was falling apart.<br><br> Ripert&#x2019;s parents divorced when he was six, separating him from the father he idolized and replacing him with a cold, bullying stepfather who insisted that Ripert be sent away to boarding school. A few years later, Ripert&#x2019;s father died on a hiking trip. Through these tough times, the one thing that gave Ripert comfort was food. Told that boys had no place in the kitchen, Ripert would instead watch from the doorway as his mother rolled couscous by hand or his grandmother pressed out the buttery dough for the treat he loved above all others,&nbsp;<i>tarte aux pommes</i>. When an eccentric local chef took him under his wing, an eleven-year-old Ripert realized that food was more than just an escape: It was his calling. That passion would carry him through the drudgery of culinary school and into the high-pressure world of Paris&#x2019;s most elite restaurants, where Ripert discovered that learning to cook was the easy part&#x2014;surviving the line was the battle.<br><br>Taking us from Eric Ripert&#x2019;s childhood in the south of France and the mountains of Andorra into the demanding kitchens of such legendary Parisian chefs as Joï¿½l Robuchon and Dominique Bouchet, until, at the age of twenty-four, Ripert made his way to the United States, <i>32 Yolks </i>is the tender and richly told story of how one of our greatest living chefs found himself&#x2014;and his home&#x2014;in the kitchen.<br><br> <b>Praise for&nbsp;<i>32 Yolks</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Passionate, poetical . . . What makes <i>32 Yolks</i> compelling is the honesty and laudable humility Ripert brings to the telling.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;With a vulnerability and honesty that is breathtaking . . . Ripert takes us into the mind of a boy with thoughts so sweet they will cause you to weep.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b></p><p><b>Eric Ripert</b> is the chef and co-owner of the New York restaurant Le Bernardin, which holds three stars from the Michelin Guide and has maintained a four-star rating from <i>The New York Times</i> for more than two decades. He is vice chairman of the board of City Harvest, a New York-based food rescue organization, as well as a recipient of the Legion d&#x2019;Honneur, France&#x2019;s highest honor. He serves as a regular guest judge on Bravo&#x2019;s<i> Top Chef</i> and is the host of his own TV series, <i>Avec Eric,</i> which has won Emmy and James Beard awards. Ripert is the author of five cookbooks: <i>Avec Eric, On the Line, A Return to Cooking, Le Bernardin: Four Star Simplicity, </i>and <i>My Best: Eric Ripert</i>.1<br><br>First, Dessert: Chocolate Mousse<br><br>Two things happened the year I turned eleven: my father died and I became friends with my first professional chef, a guy named Jacques.<br><br>My mother, distressed at my sadness over the loss of my father, tried to cure it with the one thing she knew I still loved: an extraordinary meal. One day, after she closed her shop, she announced that we wouldn&#x2019;t be going home to have dinner with her new husband, Hugo, and my baby sister. Instead we were going to the restaurant in the same complex of shops as her own, Chez Jacques.<br><br>&#x201c;It is almost impossible to get a table,&#x201d; my mother said, smiling conspiratorially. &#x201c;But why don&#x2019;t you and I go, just the two of us?&#x201d;<br><br>I smiled for the first time in weeks. A night out alone with my mother? At an exclusive restaurant? It was like Christmas had come early.<br><br>As we approached Chez Jacques, my mother whispered, &#x201c;Let me do the talking. They say the chef is a lunatic.&#x201d;<br><br>We were greeted at the door by Mercedes Quillacq, a voluptuous blond Spanish woman in her midforties. I had never met her but she greeted my mother as if they were old friends, and she seated us with a flourish that implied we were honored guests. The restaurant was rustic and simple. I would later learn that Jacques had built the entire establishment himself and that the dining room was actually the first floor of the family home. There were maybe twenty seats and an open plan kitchen, which was unusual for the time. There was no menu, just a set meal for the night. You ate what Jacques prepared, and you paid a hefty price for the pleasure.<br><br>From my seat at the table I could see Jacques at work in the kitchen: short and muscular, he wore a white chef&#x2019;s jacket with short sleeves and sweated with the force of a man who was all at once chef, sous-chef, and dishwasher. In one pot, he cooked pasta. In another, he made green beans. The industrial oven churned out culinary masterpieces, seemingly on its own. Now there&#x2019;s a platter of caramel pork. Look, there&#x2019;s a camembert en chemise (a version of brie en croute). And is that a roast duck? Watching Jacques cook for an entire restaurant, alone and happy in his kitchen, was like going to the circus and watching a master juggler spin a hundred plates. I was mesmerized.<br><br>I quickly learned that while the food was indeed legendary, part of what kept Chez Jacques packed was the show he put on. You did not choose to eat at Chez Jacques. Jacques chose you.<br><br>Ten minutes after we sat down, the door opened. A well-dressed man walked in and greeted Jacques, whose eyes immediately narrowed.<br><br>&#x201c;Get out!&#x201d; he snarled.<br><br>The man was understandably startled and tried to politely introduce himself. &#x201c;Uh, je suis Monsieur Veysette. . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who sent you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get out!&#x201d; Jacques yelled, and so the man did as he asked and left.<br><br>My mother and I sat in silence, watching the drama unfold with both amusement and awe. My pleasure in being there grew, just knowing that we had been lucky to be let in the front door.<br><br>A few minutes later, another couple arrived.<br><br>&#x201c;Who sent you?&#x201d; Jacques barked.<br><br>&#x201c;No one. We saw . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Welcome, welcome,&#x201d; Jacques said, suddenly switching to the warm tone of a mï¿½itre&#x2019;d in a famed Parisian bistro. &#x201c;Mercedes, please see to it that they get the best table!&#x201d;<br><br>My mother whispered to me, &#x201c;Chef Jacques is known for kicking even the most elite residents of Andorra out of his restaurant. He takes great pleasure in telling the richest people in town to go screw themselves, but the food is so good, they always come back.&#x201d; She went on to explain that Jacques was ex&#x2013;French Legion and he wasn&#x2019;t impressed with power. He&#x2019;d survived the Battle of Dien Bien Phu; he didn&#x2019;t care about the vice-president of the local hydroelectric company or a retired British footballer. Naturally, the spectacle only made Chez Jacques more of a destination. &#x201c;Whatever you do,&#x201d; my mother warned, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t ask for salt.&#x201d;<br><br>When the dishes arrived, it was clear that we were being presented with more than a meal: this was a gift. The salad was composed as if Jacques had spent the afternoon in the garden, picking each green leaf himself. The coq au vin was so rich and satisfying that I had to resist the urge to lick the plate when I was done. When the meal was over, Jacques sent over not two small bowls of chocolate mousse, but nearly a tub of the stuff. My eyes widened at the heft of it; then I quickly and happily polished off the whole dish.<br><br>Jacques walked over to the table just as I was shoveling the last heaping spoon of mousse into my mouth. He looked pleased.<br><br>&#x201c;The young man has a good appetite,&#x201d; he said, winking at me.<br><br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;est trop, Monsieur Jacques,&#x201d; I replied, respectfully. And it was&#x2014;the very best meal I&#x2019;d ever had.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you want a tour of the factory?&#x201d; Jacques asked, gesturing for me to follow him to the kitchen.<br><br>My mother nodded her permission and I eagerly followed Jacques back to the kitchen and propped myself onto a barstool for a better view. I pointed at the salads Jacques was making.<br><br>&#x201c;How did you get the vinaigrette so creamy?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>He smiled at the question. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a secret,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Come back one day and I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d;<br><br>The next day after school, instead of heading to the stockroom above my mother&#x2019;s boutique, I went to Chez Jacques. I sat on the same barstool, eating bowl after bowl of baba au rhum, and listened as he told me stories about his years in the military.<br><br>Jacques was what was called a titi Parisien, a kind of scrappy, working-class guy who grew up on the not-fancy streets of Paris, like Robert De Niro in New York. He spent his career as a parachutist with the French army and had done tours of duty in Vietnam, Egypt, and Algeria. I learned more about history from him than I did from any schoolbook.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve read about the coalition between Germany, France, and Great Britain against Egypt when they tried to nationalize the Suez Canal?&#x201d; he asked as he rubbed a leg of lamb with salt for that evening&#x2019;s meal.<br><br>I had never heard of the Suez Canal, but I nodded my head vigorously in the hopes that he&#x2019;d keep talking and serving me sweets.<br><br>&#x201c;Alors. Each country had their own black market of goods,&#x201d; Jacques explained. &#x201c;Crates of everything from caviar to licorice. Well, one day, we heard that the British had gotten ahold of some fresh vegetables, so we traded with them&#x2014;a crate of whiskey for a crate of arugula, endives, and romaine. They just wanted to get drunk! But we said, &#x2018;The French must eat the way God intended man to eat!&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>He laughed so hard at the memory that he had to brace himself on the counter. &#x201c;Can you imagine? Trading whiskey for some greens? But that is war, young man. That is what war is really about: going after the thing you didn&#x2019;t value until you were in the position to lose it.&#x201d;<br><br>I was only a kid but I thought I understood what he meant, because I had, that afternoon, spent one of the happiest days in recent memory. The school year loomed ahead, and I was sure that nothing would top the few hours I had spent watching Jacques cook and listening to his stories about parachuting out of planes and conducting secret maneuvers in foreign lands.<br><br>My mother worked six days a week at her boutique, but she cooked like a Michelin-starred chef every single night. The table was always set with fresh flowers and a beautiful tablecloth. She shopped every day at the markets. We began each meal with a delicious starter: maybe an onion soup or a big rustic salad made of blanched and raw vegetables, apple, avocado, radishes, potato, haricots verts, corn&#x2014;all from a roadside market, not the grocery store. For the main course, there would be something cooked ï¿½ la minute, like a pepper steak, or something she&#x2019;d prepped since the morning, like a roast shoulder of lamb. There was always dessert too: a fruit dish, like pears in red wine, on the weekdays and something more elaborate, like a flan or a raspberry/strawberry/pear tart, on her day off. It was a badge of honor for my mother that at a time when women were asking if they could have it all, she did.<br><br>That evening when she came to collect me, her eyes went straight to the dirty dessert bowl sitting next to me. She knew me well enough to know that there was no way I had eaten just one serving. I could tell she was annoyed at what was certain to be an enormous bill and at my rudeness in ruining my appetite for the dinner she&#x2019;d prepared at home.<br><br>But when my mother asked Jacques for the bill, throwing me an impatient glare, he just waved her off.<br><br>&#x201c;No charge, madame,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;The boy has been washing dishes all day. It is I who should pay him.&#x201d; Then he winked at me and smiled.<br><br>This was, needless to say, a lie for my protection, and the pure tenderness of the gesture almost made me cry.<br><br>&#x201c;Come back anytime,&#x201d; Jacques said. I wondered if he meant it or if he was just being polite.<br><br>&#x201c;Tomorrow?&#x201d; I asked, shyly.<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; he answered.<br><br>&#x201c;Will there be chocolate mousse the next time?&#x201d; I asked, feeling bolder.<br><br>Jacques laughed, a full-bodied laugh that I would get to know well. And my mother, who in those days did not laugh very often, laughed too.<br><br>&#x201c;There is always chocolate mousse at Chez Jacques,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Proust had his madeleine and because of Jacques, I have my mousse. Every time I dig into a bowl of that chocolate velvet, I am a kid again, running to Chez Jacques after school. It is the taste of friendship. It is the taste of belly laughs, and war stories, and the memory of a man who could jump out of planes and make a leg of lamb with equal amounts of skill and ardor. But more than anything, chocolate mousse is the taste of being welcomed; of Chez Jacques, where for me, the door was always open.<br><br>2<br><br>My Father&#x2019;s Castle<br><br>In 1961, Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier came to Paris to make a movie about jazz, love, and possibility. In the film, Paul Newman plays a jazz musician who sees the most beautiful girl, played by Diahann Carroll, while walking down the street. She&#x2019;s not interested in him, but she takes a liking to his friend, Sidney Poitier, and it just so happens that her pal, Joanne Woodward, thinks Paul Newman is kind of cute. So the pairs switch around and go about the business of falling in love, but in the end, each of the men and each of the women must go off on their own path. There is no happily ever after for these couples, only happy to have met you.<br><br>Not too long after that movie debuted, my parents met in the south of France. In time, they would do their own switching around of partners and falling in and out of love. But where the lovers in Paris Blues had only themselves to worry about, my parents&#x2019; choices affected me too, and I felt shuffled and tossed about by all of the changes. Despite all that would come afterward, the first five years of my life were so happy and bright that decades cannot diminish the sunshine and warmth that I feel when I look back at that time. My parents&#x2019; greatest gift to me was this: a model of love that was so big, it felt like the stuff of movies and songs. It wasn&#x2019;t an endless love, but it was a gift all the same. <br><br>This is where it began: on a road lined with olive trees, on a bright summer day in Cagnes-sur-Mer, the largest suburb of the city of Nice. My mother, Monique, was waiting for the No. 44 bus. She had golden brown skin, the skin of a girl who has spent her whole life in sunny places&#x2014;Morocco and the south of France. She was tall and thin, with hair as black as a raven that hit her back at an alluring spot. Her eyes were rimmed with kohl; her lips were a deep ruby red. My mother was just an eighteen-year-old shopgirl, but she had mastered the look of the jet set. She carried herself with confidence&#x2014;even a slight arrogance&#x2014;that men found irresistible. She was a prize, and she knew it.<br><br>My father, Andrï¿½, was ten years her senior. He was handsome and he knew it, the golden boy and oldest son of a farming family in Nï¿½mes. He was born at the dawn of the Second World War. Like many in France, his family suffered greatly through the wars and he was determined to make a success of himself.

In testament to the endurance and vitality of her message, each of her eight legendary bestsellers -- from <i>Don't Fall Off the Mountain</i> to <i>My Lucky Stars</i> -- continues today to attract, dazzle, and transform countless new readers. Now Shirley is back -- with her most breathtakingly powerful and unique book yet. <br> This is the story of a journey. It is the eagerly anticipated and altogether startling culmination of Shirley MacLaine's extraordinary -- and ultimately rewarding -- road through life. The riveting odyssey began with a pair of anonymous handwritten letters imploring Shirley to make a difficult pilgrimage along the Santiago de Compostela Camino in Spain. Throughout history, countless illustrious pilgrims from all over Europe have taken up the trail. It is an ancient -- and allegedly enchanted -- pilgrimage. People from St. Francis of Assisi and Charlemagne to Ferdinand and Isabella to Dante and Chaucer have taken the journey, which comprises a nearly 500-mile trek across highways, mountains and valleys, cities and towns, and fields. Now it would be Shirley's turn. <br> For Shirley, the Camino was both an intense spiritual and physical challenge. A woman in her sixth decade completing such a grueling trip on foot in thirty days at twenty miles per day was nothing short of remarkable. But even more astounding was the route she took spiritually: back thousands of years, through past lives to the very origin of the universe. Immensely gifted with intelligence, curiosity, warmth, and a profound openness to people and places outside her own experience, Shirley MacLaine is truly an American treasure. And once again, she brings her inimitable qualities of mind and heart to her writing. Balancing and negotiating the revelations inspired by the mysterious energy of the Camino, she endured her exhausting journey to Compostela until it gradually gave way to a far more universal voyage: that of the soul. Through a range of astonishing and liberating visions and revelations, Shirley saw into the meaning of the cosmos, including the secrets of the ancient civilizations of Atlantis and Lemuria, insights into human genesis, the essence of gender and sexuality, and the true path to higher love. <br> With rich insight, humility, and her trademark grace, Shirley MacLaine gently leads us on a sacred adventure toward an inexpressibly transcendent climax. <i>The Camino</i> promises readers the journey of a thousand lifetimes.</p><p>Known as the Camino, the Santiago de Compostela Camino is a famous pilgrimage that has been undertaken by people for centuries across northern Spain. It is said that this 500-mile path lies directly under the Milky Way and that it reflects the energy of the star systems above it. Facing her sixth decade of life on earth, writer and actor Shirley MacLaine decided to go on this trek. She wasn't sure why, she only knew that the Camino had been traveled for thousands of years by "saints, sinners, generals, misfits, kings and queens. It is done by the intent to find one's deepest spiritual meaning and resolutions regarding conflicts in Self."<p> Typical of MacLaine, this is a personal story with enormous adventure, a smattering of flashbacks, and a hefty serving of cosmic revelations. Like a true pilgrim, MacLaine travels solo, willing to strip herself down to the backpacking essentials and find deeper meaning in all the bizarre, frightening, and coincidental events she encounters along the way. It is no small feat that this sixtysomething woman walked the grueling path in 30 days. Readers can expect vivid stories of stalking paparazzi, icy showers, bouts of hunger, lost paths, a worshipping young man, a deranged woman screaming in a roadside shelter, saintly truck drivers, a fellow pilgrim in a wheelchair, bouts of constipation and diarrhea, and a cosmic crescendo that will knock the socks of MacLaine's fans. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Shirley MacLaine has appeared in more than fifty films, has been nominated&nbsp;for an Academy Award six times, and received the Oscar for Best Actress in 1984 for <i>Terms of Endearment</i>. She also recently starred in the hit TV show <i>Downton Abbey</i>. A longtime outspoken advocate for civil rights and liberties, she is the author of ten international bestsellers. She lives in Malibu, California, and Santa Fe, New Mexico.</p><h2>The Master Key System</h2><p><p>First published as a 24-week correspondence course in 1912, and then as a book in 1916, Charles F. Haanel&#x2019;s &#x201c;<em>The Master Key System</em>&#x201d; is a classic work of self-empowerment. A principal text of the New Thought movement, &#x201c;<em>The Master Key System</em>&#x201d; describes how one can use the law of attraction to creatively visualize a better life for oneself. As Haanel describes in his introduction to the &#x201c;<em>The Master Key System</em>&#x201d;, &#x201c;Nature compels us all to move through life. We could not remain stationary however much we wished. Every right-thinking person wants not merely to move through life like a sound-producing, perambulating plant, but to develop&#x2014;to improve&#x2014;and to continue the development mentally to the close of physical life. This development can occur only through the improvement of the quality of individual thought and the ideals, actions and conditions that arise as a consequence. Hence a study of the creative processes of thought and how to apply them is of supreme importance to each one of us. This knowledge is the means whereby the evolution of human life on earth may be hastened and uplifted in the process.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p></p><h2>Secrets of the Psalms</h2><p>This book presents ways to communicate with the higher levels of our creation.

Ziggy&#x2019;s enthusiastically loud singing voice echoed through the room. He sang as much as he could remember of &#x201c;On Top of Old Smoky&#x201d; while he lathered himself with his favorite shower gel. It smelled like grapes.

He got himself dressed for school, choosing a bright red T-shirt and purple cut-off shorts. He continued to sing, this time trying out his favorite Jamaican folk song.

They had built a clubhouse in Ziggy&#x2019;s backyard, and they had meetings when they felt like it&#x2014;usually on Saturdays during the school year. Sometimes they met just to goof off and eat pizza, and sometimes they tried to solve neighborhood mysteries.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think you should win the competition before you start spending the money?&#x201d; Ziggy&#x2019;s mother asked with a chuckle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, we&#x2019;ll win, Mum,&#x201d; Ziggy said with confidence. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll win for sure. Didn&#x2019;t you just hear me singing?&#x201d; He ate a cold piece of pizza and drank a cup of warm chicken soup for his breakfast.<br> <br>His mother laughed out loud. &#x201c;Yes, son, I heard you singing. Loud and clear. Have a great day at school, and good luck at the tryouts.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ziggy waved good-bye and headed out the door, bursting into song once again. He headed down the street, his arms swinging beside him in rhythm with the music.<br> <br>&#x201c;SHE&#x2019;LL BE COMING &#x2019;ROUND THE MOUNTAIN WHEN SHE COMES.<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE COMING &#x2019;ROUND THE MOUNTAIN WHEN SHE COMES.<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE COMING &#x2019;ROUND THE MOUNTAIN,<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE COMING &#x2019;ROUND THE MOUNTAIN,<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE COMING &#x2019;ROUND THE MOUNTAIN WHEN SHE COMES.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ziggy was so caught up in his singing that he didn&#x2019;t notice when Rico, Jerome, and Rashawn tiptoed behind him. They put their hands to their mouths, stifling their giggles as they followed Ziggy, imitating his every move. Ziggy continued to sing at the top of his lungs.<br> <br>&#x201c;SHE&#x2019;LL BE WEARING RED PAJAMAS WHEN SHE COMES.<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE WEARING RED PAJAMAS WHEN SHE COMES.<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE WEARING RED PAJAMAS,<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE WEARING RED PAJAMAS,<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE WEARING RED PAJAMAS WHEN SHE COMES.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Red pajamas?&#x201d; Rashawn finally said, as he bumped into Ziggy. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s gonna be wearing red pj&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And what&#x2019;s her name?&#x201d; Rico asked with a laugh. &#x201c;Nobody knows her name! All you ever hear is she!&#x201d;<br> <br>Ziggy stopped, turned, and made a funny face, and the four friends burst into laughter. &#x201c;You been followin&#x2019; me? Tryin&#x2019; to take notes so you can sing as good as Ziggy at the tryouts?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, right,&#x201d; Jerome said, bumping Ziggy on the other side.<br> <br>The four boys lived on the same street and usually walked to school together in the morning. The school building, which was only a couple of blocks away from where the boys lived, had been built more than a hundred years ago. It was large and brown and scary-looking at night, but in the daytime the boys had decided it just looked old and tired.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought we were going to sing as a group&#x2014;a quartet,&#x201d; Rico said.<br> <br>&#x201c;We are,&#x201d; Jerome answered with excitement. &#x201c;The four of us are gonna be so good at the talent show that some big-time recording dude will probably try to cut us a CD!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah!&#x201d; Rashawn added. &#x201c;And offer us a million-dollar recording contract!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And we&#x2019;ll have our pictures on the cover, mon!&#x201d; Ziggy said, posing as if for a camera.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;You think we ought to practice a little more for the tryouts first?&#x201d; Rico asked sensibly. The boys had been practicing their singing routine for weeks now. They had added dance moves and had even talked about costumes for the show.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good idea, mon!&#x201d; Ziggy said cheerfully. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go behind the school before the bell rings and make sure we&#x2019;ve got our act together. We don&#x2019;t want anyone to copy our moves!&#x201d;<br> <br>The boys ran eagerly toward the school, all four of them loudly singing more crazy verses to &#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be Coming &#x2019;Round the Mountain.&#x201d; Ziggy started out, and the other three boys joined in.<br> <br>&#x201c;SHE&#x2019;LL BE EATING FRENCH-FRIED CARROTS WHEN SHE COMES.<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE EATING F&#x2019;RENCH-FRIED CARROTS WHEN SHE COMES.<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE EATING FRENCH-FRIED CARROTS,<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE EATING FRENCH-FRIED CARROTS,<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE EATING FRENCH-FRIED CARROTS WHEN SHE COMES.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;SHE&#x2019;LL BE RIDING ON A SKATEBOARD WHEN SHE COMES.<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE RIDING ON A SKATEBOARD WHEN SHE COMES.<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE RIDING ON A SKATEBOARD,<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE RIDING ON A SKATEBOARD,<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE RIDING ON A SKATEBOARD WHEN SHE COMES.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;SHE&#x2019;LL BE SMELLING LIKE A MONKEY WHEN SHE COMES.<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE SMELLING LIKE A MONKEY WHEN SHE COMES.<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE SMELLING LIKE A MONKEY,<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE SMELLING LIKE A MONKEY,<br> <br>SHE&#x2019;LL BE SMELLING LIKE A MONKEY WHEN SHE COMES.&#x201d;<br> <br>The sillier the verses got, the more the boys laughed as they sang. When they got to their school, they ran to the back of the building instead of waiting at the front door with the other students. Tall grasses grew in the ragged field behind the building. In the distance, their gravel-covered track waited for runners, and the old wooden bleachers sat empty. Most of the athletic areas of their school were sadly in need of repair. They were not quite broken, but they were very old and cried out for modernization.<br> <br>Ziggy and his friends paid no attention, however, to the grass-covered athletic areas, but stayed close to the building where there was more dusty ground than flowers. The shadow of the school building made it cool and shady where they stood.<br> <br>&#x201c;You ready to try our four-part harmony?&#x201d; Rico asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, mon!&#x201d; Ziggy said excitedly. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jerome, who had a beautiful baritone voice, started out by giving them a note. Each boy then used it to find his own place in the four-part harmony. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s try &#x2018;Home on the Range,&#x2019;&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll start with the refrain. Ready?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ready,&#x201d; the others said, paying close attention.<br> <br>&#x201c;Home,&#x201d; Jerome sang in a voice that was pretty close to baritone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Home,&#x201d; chimed in Rashawn&#x2019;s deep bass. Sometimes his voice cracked, but he was proud of how he could usually reach the low notes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Home.&#x201d; Rico&#x2019;s shaky tenor mixed in perfectly.<br> <br>Finally Ziggy added his voice. &#x201c;Home,&#x201d; he sang in a voice that was not quite tenor and not quite baritone, but always loud and enthusiastic. But he was on key, and the other boys nodded in approval as Ziggy hit the right note.<br> <br>&#x201c;HOME, HOME ON THE RANGE,<br> <br>WHERE THE DEER AND THE ANTELOPE PLAY,<br> <br>WHERE SELDOM IS HEARD,<br> <br>A DISCOURAGING WORD,<br> <br>AND THE SKIES ARE NOT CLOUDY ALL DAY.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, now!&#x201d; Jerome said with enthusiasm. &#x201c;We sound really good!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah!&#x201d; they all said in agreement, slapping hands.<br> <br>&#x201c;Should we sing that one for the tryouts?&#x201d; Rico asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got all day to decide,&#x201d; Rashawn said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s get to class now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Just then the bell rang and the four friends gathered up their book bags and scrambled to enter the building from the front. None of them noticed the car that was parked in the tall grass behind the athletic stands.</p><h2>Murakami: Ego</h2><p>A comprehensive volume&#x2014;overseen by the artist himself&#x2014;on one of the most renowned living artists today, Takashi Murakami. Takashi Murakami is celebrated the world over for his deft blurring of high and low art. In this volume, accompanying a major exhibition of his work and the first in the Middle East, readers are immersed in the unique way Murakami channels the ecstasy and anxiety of contemporary culture. Conceived by the artist as a self-portrait in the guise of a cartoon, Murakami &#x2013; Ego illuminates the role of the artist as a cipher and critic of pop phenomena as well as a mirror of global networks of consumerism, interpretation, and exchange. The book features some of the artist&#x2019;s most celebrated series, including Kaikai Kiki Lots of Faces and Pom and Me. Murakami has conceived of the exhibition itself as a work of art, creating new modes of display that include sculptural pedestals with digital animation, a circus tent that doubles as an indoor cinema, and an impressive 300-foot-long painting, all of which are featured in the book. In addition to an interview by curator Massimiliano Gioni, Murakami will contribute writings on various works.</p><p>Takashi Murakami has become recognized as one of the most prominent contemporary artists of his time. His work has been featured in numerous solo exhibitions at museums and art institutions throughout the world. Recent shows include the traveling retrospective ï¿½MURAKAMI and the Chï¿½teau de Versailles&#x2019;s solo exhibition of his works on the palace grounds. Massimiliano Gioni is the associate director and director of exhibitions for the New Museum in New York and the curator of the exhibition Murakami &#x2013; Ego for the Qatar Museums Authority.The decisive influence of Japan upon the development of contemporary culture needs little recounting. Western artists, from Manet and Monet forward, have adapted design principles found in Japanese prints to create compositions of increasing flatness and abstraction. The philosophy of Zen Buddhism has influenced a range of practices in Western painting, music, and dance since the mid-twentieth century. In recent decades, Japanese consumer products--from electronics to automobiles--have profoundly affected societies worldwide, while the products of Japanese popular culture--anime and manga in particular--have found an international audience. In his work and unique practice, Takashi Murakami seemingly picks out and reconfigures the disparate threads of Japanese influence that have been woven into the fabric of international culture over the last one hundred-plus years. If only for this reason, Murakami has swiftly risen to the position of one of the most influential and acclaimed artists to emerge from Asia in the postwar era. Murakami is now a distinct "brand"; his career is marked by extraordinary levels of ambition and achievement, and his work offers a brilliant and unique synthesis of the personal and the commercial. Trained in the school of nihonga--traditional Japanese-style painting--Murakami has created works that bridge that tradition and the worlds of contemporary art, design, animation, fashion, and popular culture. Extending the trajectory of production by artists such as Andy Warhol and Jeff Koons, his oeuvre not only includes painting, sculpture, installation, and animation, but also a wide range of collectibles, multiples, and commercial products. Murakami expands the role of the artist well beyond its traditional boundaries--Western or Japanese. In conjunction with heading his international corporation Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd., which has three locations in Japan and New York, he continues to incorporate a vast range of activities, taking on the responsibilities of curator, entrepreneur, publisher, lecturer, events coordinator, and manager. The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA), has been privileged to host Murakami on several previous occasions. In 2001, the influential "Superflat," a Murakami-organized exhibition of work by young Japanese artists, inaugurated MOCA's Pacific Design Center gallery. That same year, his work was featured in "Public Offerings," organized by Chief Curator Paul Schimmel. In 2004, Aya Takano, an artist managed by Murakami who also participated in "Superflat," launched The world after 800,000,000 years for MOCA's online digital gallery. Most recently, in 2005, Murakami's DOB in the Strange Forest and Super Nova (both 1999) were on display at The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA as a part of "Ecstasy: In and About Altered States," also organized by Schimmel. MOCA's ongoing relationship with Murakami culminates in "ï¿½ Murakami," the artist's largest survey exhibition to date, including over ninety works from his extensive oeuvre, a broad range of Kaikai Kiki merchandise, and a fully operational Louis Vuitton boutique featuring new designs by the artist as an integral element of the exhibition. "ï¿½ Murakami" continues the museum's longstanding dedication to the organization and presentation of exhibitions by exceptional and challenging mid-career artists, including Douglas Gordon, Rodney Graham, Barbara Kruger, Gabriel Orozco, Charles Ray, and Christopher Wool. This exhibition would not have been possible without the tremendous vision of Paul Schimmel, whose own passion and excitement for Murakami's work has fueled their ongoing relationship over the years. Schimmel, who gained Murakami's attention with his landmark 1992 show "Helter Skelter: L.A. Art in the 1990s" at MOCA, has been pivotal in creating a basis for understanding the artist's work in Los Angeles through exhibitions such as "Public Offerings" and "Ecstasy." Working closely with the artist with the assistance of Mika Yoshitake, project coordinator, and Yuko Sakata, executive director of Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd., Schimmel has tailored an outstanding exhibition that will present Murakami's work in its full breadth to American and European audiences. Exhibitions like "ï¿½ Murakami," unusual for art museums in their scale, ambition, and complexity, rely upon the most devoted and visionary supporters for their realization. I wish to express my unending gratitude to MOCA's extraordinary Board of Trustees, led by Chair Clifford J. Einstein, President Dallas Price-Van Breda, and Vice Chair Michael Sandler, for their commitment, with special thanks to Audrey Irmas through the Sydney Irmas Exhibition Endowment, William and Maria Bell, Dallas Price-Van Breda, and Tom and Janet Unterman for their particular support. I am deeply grateful to exhibition sponsors Blum &amp; Poe, Steven and Alexandra Cohen, Kathi and Gary Cypres, Gagosian Gallery, Galerie Emmanuel Perrotin, The Norton Family Foundation, Marianne Boesky, David Teiger, The MOCA Contemporaries, The Japan Foundation, and the E. Rhodes and Leona B. Carpenter Foundation. My most profound gratitude goes to Takashi Murakami for his revelatory and transformative work, his commitment to MOCA, and his tireless dedication to this exhibition. His energy and the amazing efforts of Kaikai Kiki Co., Ltd., have brought this exhibition to the highest level.</p><h2>A Well-Crafted Home: Inspiration and 60 Projects for Personalizing Your Space</h2><p><b><b>From "the DIY maven" (<i>Architectural Digest</i>), comes a</b>&nbsp;beautiful, practical craft book for both aspiring and seasoned makers. </b>Here are 60 projects for high-quality furniture, textiles, and accessories&nbsp;to enjoy all through the house--plus all the techniques you need for dyeing or sewing fabric, cutting leather, antiquing mirrors, working with wood, and much more.<br><i><br>A Well-Crafted Home</i> includes simple, creative details that will tailor a space to your taste.

Each morning, he checked and balanced his scales, and he took great care to give his customers exactly what they paid for -- not more and not less.&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Amsterdam's shop was always busy, because people trusted him, and because he was a good baker as well. And never was the shop busier than in the days before December 6, when the Dutch celebrate Saint Nicholas Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time of year, people flocked to the baker's shop to buy his fine Saint Nicholas cookies. Made of gingerbread, iced in red and white, they looked just like Saint Nicholas as the Dutch know him -- tall and thin, with a high, red bishop's cap, and a long, red bishop's cloak.&nbsp;&nbsp;One Saint Nicholas Day morning, the baker was just ready for business, when the door of his shop flew open. In walked an old woman, wrapped in a long black shawl.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I have come for a dozen of your Saint Nicholas cookies."&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking a tray, Van Amsterdam counted out twelve cookies. He started to wrap them, but the woman reached out and stopped him.&nbsp;&nbsp;"I asked for a dozen. You have given me only twelve."&nbsp;&nbsp;"Madam," said the baker, "everyone knows that a dozen is twelve."&nbsp;&nbsp;"But I say a dozen is thirteen," said the woman. "Give me one more."&nbsp;&nbsp;Van Amsterdam was not a man to bear foolishness.

Every month, the women would huddle in a friend&#x2019;s apartment to share sexist job frustrations and trade tips on how best to tackle them. Once upon a time, you might have called it a consciousness-raising group. But the problems of today&#x2019;s working world are more subtle, less pronounced, harder to identify&#x2014;and harder to prove&#x2014;than those of our foremothers. These women weren&#x2019;t just there to vent. They needed battle tactics. And so the Feminist Fight Club was born.<strong></strong><p></p><p></p>In <em>Feminist Fight Club</em>, acclaimed journalist Jessica Bennett blends the personal stories of her real-life fight club with research, statistics, and no-bullsh*t advice for how to combat today&#x2019;s sexism (and come out the other side). Part manual, part manifesto, Bennett offers a new vocabulary for the sexist archetypes women encounter every day&#x2014;such as the Manterrupter, who talks over female colleagues in meetings; or the Bropropriator, who appropriates their ideas&#x2014;as well as the self-sabotaging behavior women sometimes exhibit themselves. With original illustrations and fascinating historical research as well as a straightforward assessment of the gender gap that continues to plague the American workforce, <em>Feminist Fight Club</em> offers practical strategies, stealthy hacks, and much-needed camaraderie for women battling their way through the modern workplace.<p>Jessica Bennett is an award-winning journalist and critic.

In this bold new look at human behavior, award-winning journalist and Olympian Matthew Syed explores the truth about our competitive natureï¿½why we win, why we don't, and how we really play the game of life. </p> <p> <i>Bounce</i> reveals how competitionï¿½the most vivid, primal, and dramatic of human pursuitsï¿½provides vital insight into many of the most controversial issues of our time. From biology and economics to psychology and culture, from genetics and race to sports and politics, <i>Bounce</i> shows how competition provides a master key with which to unlock the mysteries of the world. </p></p><p><p>A two-time Olympian and a graduate of Oxford University, Matthew Syed is a columnist for <em>The Times</em> (London), a commentator for the BBC, and a recipient of the British Press Award for Sports Journalist of the Year, and was named British Sports Feature Writer of the Year by the Sports Journalists' Association. </p>Syed, sportswriter and columnist for the London <i>Times</i>, takes a hard look at performance psychology, heavily influenced by his own ego-damaging but fruitful epiphany. At the age of 24, Syed became the #1 British table tennis player, an achievement he initially attributed to his superior speed and agility. But in retrospect, he realizes that a combination of advantages&#x2014;a mentor, good facilities nearby, and lots of time to hone his skills&#x2014;set him up perfectly to become a star performer. He admits his argument owes a debt to Malcolm Gladwell's <i>Outliers</i>, but he aims to move one step beyond it, drawing on cognitive neuroscience research to explain how the body and mind are transformed by specialized practice. He takes on the myth of the child prodigy, emphasizing that Mozart, the Williams sisters, Tiger Woods, and Susan Polgar, the first female grandmaster, all had live-in coaches in the form of supportive parents who put them through a ton of early practice. Cogent discussions of the neuroscience of competition, including the placebo effect of irrational optimism, self-doubt, and superstitions, all lend credence to a compelling narrative; readers who gobbled up <i>Freakonomics</i> and <i>Predictably Irrational</i> will flock to this one. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In 2014, the Astros were the worst baseball team in half a century, but just three years later they defied critics to win a stunning World Series. In this book, Ben Reiter shows how the Astros built a system that avoided the stats-versus-scouts divide by giving the human factor a key role in their decision-making.

He lives in New York City with his family.1<br><br>Gut Feels<br><br>In the late 1980s, when people got too drunk and were kicked out of the other casinos in Lake Tahoe, they ended up at Del Webb&#x2019;s High Sierra, a place where there was no such thing as too drunk. Sometimes they staggered by indifferent security guards who were costumed as Wild West deputies, past stages adorned with fake tumbleweeds, and over to a blackjack table manned by a tall, thin young dealer with thick black hair.<br><br>&#x201c;Sig?&#x201d; they would say, squinting at the tag pinned to his chest. &#x201c;What kind of name is that?&#x201d;<br><br>Sig Mejdal was an undergraduate at the University of California, Davis, studying mechanical engineering and aeronautical engineering. During the summers he&#x2019;d head 120 miles east, clip an oversize bow tie to his collar, and sling cards at Tahoe&#x2019;s seediest betting house. He thought the tie made him look more like someone with a dead cat draped around his neck than a Dodge City barman&#x2014;ï¿½or like a Dodge City barman who hunted house pets, best case&#x2014;ï¿½but he loved the job anyway. It was more fun than the internships his classmates at Davis pursued, and more lucrative, too. He would spend the day at the beach, deal all night, fling the hundred bucks he&#x2019;d made in tips onto the steadily accumulating pile on his dresser in the morning, and head back to the beach.<br><br>At the High Sierra, he learned things he knew he couldn&#x2019;t have in a lab. The best way to get someone to stop smoking at his table, for example. When a gambler rested his cigarette on the edge of his ashtray, Sig would subtly put a little extra on the next card he dealt to him, so that it hit the cigarette and knocked it onto the felt or the ground in a shower of sparks. The player, embarrassed and believing it to have been an accident, usually didn&#x2019;t light up again.<br><br>Sig also learned something that he would use more frequently during his future professional career. He learned that human beings do not always make decisions that serve their own long-ï¿½term self-ï¿½interest, even when they are equipped with a wealth of experience and knowledge of the mathematical probabilities that ought to guide their choices.<br><br>Blackjack is a probabilistic game. For any combination of cards, the player&#x2019;s and the dealer&#x2019;s, there is an optimal action for the player to take in order to increase his chances of winning&#x2014;ï¿½or, generally, of losing less. Sometimes, the action is both easy and obvious. You hit a 10, against anything. Often, though, players know what they ought to do from a probabilistic perspective, but they do something else, because their intuition tells them to.<br><br>Even the sober patrons of the High Sierra usually declined to hit on a 16 against a dealer&#x2019;s 7, because it sucked to bust, especially with a big bet on the table. The mathematically sound move was to take another card, though. It was a bad hand no matter what, but standing led to a loss rate of 74 percent&#x2014;ï¿½the chances were that the dealer would pull a 17, at minimum&#x2014;ï¿½while hitting decreased that to 67.5 percent, even factoring in the busts, a big difference in the long run. Sometimes, even other dealers, who saw more than 100,000 hands a year, with immediate feedback, advised players to stand.<br><br>This, to Sig, illustrated the limitations of human judgment. &#x201c;Just because it feels right,&#x201d; he told himself, &#x201c;doesn&#x2019;t mean it is right.&#x201d; Human beings tended to trust the combination of experience, intuition, and emotion that comprised their gut. Their gut certainly had value. Sometimes their gut was wrong.<br><br>When he wasn&#x2019;t spending his free time at the beach, Sig spread his wrinkled tip money onto the blackjack table himself. He rarely won. The house&#x2019;s advantage was the house&#x2019;s advantage. Playing the right way, though, he lost slowly, and when he factored in the complimentary drinks he consumed in the process, he considered it a financial wash.<br><br>Sig and the other dealers marveled at the way gamblers they had wiped out would unquestioningly follow the custom of tossing their last few chips to them for the trouble, sparing the casino the burden of paying them more than minimum wage. A hundred bucks a day was good money, and many dealers decided to make a career out of their summer gig. Sig did not.<br><br>He graduated from Davis and went on to earn two master&#x2019;s degrees, in operations research and cognitive psychology, from San Jose State. He took a job at Lockheed Martin, where he helped launch satellites into orbit. Then he performed research for NASA&#x2019;s Fatigue Countermeasures Group, where, among other things, he revealed the relative uselessness of napping. Even though tired subjects believed that naps fully restored their ability to perform, that turned out to be empirically untrue unless they had gone through a full night&#x2019;s sleep cycle.<br><br>Sig was initially inspired to undertake that study not by astronauts, but by a different type of American hero: baseball players. He had wondered how the performance of major leaguers from the East Coast was affected when they traveled to play in different time zones, interrupting their circadian rhythms. In fact, the entirety of Sig&#x2019;s mathematically driven career had stemmed from his passion for our most mathematically driven sport.<br><br>Unlike many American boys, Sig did not inherit his love of ï¿½baseball from his parents. His father, Svend, came from Denmark, and his mother, Norma, grew up in Colombia. They each arrived in the United States in their 20s, and met in the US Army, an officer and a nurse. Sig&#x2019;s older brother, Svend Jr., was born in France, while his parents were stationed there. Norma gave birth to Sig&#x2014;ï¿½Sigurd, ï¿½actually&#x2014;ï¿½in California in 1965, when Svend Sr. was in Vietnam.<br><br>Nobody could ever pronounce the family&#x2019;s last name, Mejdal, until a friend of Sig&#x2019;s came up with a mnemonic chant. &#x201c;Whose dell?&#x201d; the friend asked. &#x201c;My dell!&#x201d; Sig shouted. If some of his peers still stumbled on his surname, Sig had little trouble connecting with them via a pastime neither of his parents much understood.<br><br>He spent great swaths of his childhood flicking the spinners of All-ï¿½Star Baseball, a board game that allowed players to simulate major league contests. Each year the game&#x2019;s maker, Cadaco-ï¿½Ellis, released a new set of circular, insertable cards representing players both current and past. Each card was divided into fourteen zones, sized to correspond with the player&#x2019;s statistics, on which the spinner might land. A slugger&#x2019;s card might have had large zones for No. 1 (Home Run) and No. 10 (Strikeout), while slap hitters&#x2019; cards featured more room for the spinner to end up on No. 7 (Single) or No. 11 (Double). Sig favored the latter. He loved the 1894 Baltimore Orioles of Dan Brouthers and Wee Willie Keeler.<br><br>He began subscribing to newsletters produced by the Society of American Baseball Research, or SABR. When he was in sixth grade, he read a paper that included a formula that could predict how many runs and runs batted in a given player should amass based on the number and type of hits he had. The analyst had worked backward from real run totals to determine how much each constituent part contributed to them. This was called regression analysis.<br><br>Sig wrote a rudimentary program on his Atari 800 computer that allowed him to project those results for his All-ï¿½Star Baseball players, like Brouthers and Keeler, and he recorded his players&#x2019; stats in reams of notebooks. &#x201c;It seemed magical,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It was why I liked math.&#x201d;<br><br>He played simulated season after simulated season, competing against not only his buddy from across the street but, after responding to an ad in a newsletter, retirees across the country by mail on the honor system. In his imagination, his living room became the site of nerve-ï¿½rattling championships won by legendary players under his control. &#x201c;These heroic actions would be taking place whenever you wanted, in your living room,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d keep track of the statistics and get excited by the drama, as if this was important.&#x201d;<br><br>To the even deeper mystification of his parents, Sig also played six years of Little League, from the fourth grade through the ninth. He was so skinny that he could rarely lift the ball out of the infield. His mother inadvertently sat in the wrong bleachers and cheered whenever the umpire called him out, which was almost always.<br><br>Sig loved it anyway, especially after he began reading the annual Baseball Abstract self-ï¿½published by Bill James, the godfather of sabermetrics&#x2014;ï¿½the statistical analysis of baseball data. When he wasn&#x2019;t in right field&#x2014;ï¿½where the coaches always played him, hoping that a ball wouldn&#x2019;t be squibbed his way&#x2014;ï¿½he calculated James&#x2019;s pioneering statistics, designed to capture a player&#x2019;s value better than batting average or home run totals could, for each one of his teammates. Every member of the 1981 Papagallos of San Jose&#x2019;s Union Little League had a Runs Created, whether he knew it or not.<br><br>Even so, as a teenager there was only one career path Sig could imagine following. &#x201c;I have immigrant parents,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;They wanted their son to make it in this country. I was brainwashed since grade school to be an engineer, and I don&#x2019;t think I ever rethought it.&#x201d; His one minor rebellion, the summers he&#x2019;d spent at the High Sierra rather than buttressing his rï¿½sumï¿½ with internships, turned out to be his best piece of luck: The hiring manager at Lockheed loved blackjack.<br><br>&#x201c;I wanted a job,&#x201d; Sig said. &#x201c;This was fine.&#x201d; In fact, it was undeniably cool to become an expert in subsystems that controlled a rocket, and to be responsible for averting mistakes that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Still, to Sig it felt remote, bloodless. The rockets and satellites were thousands of miles away, and success meant they stayed on course. They always did.<br><br>For most engineers, a well-ï¿½paid job like that would have been enough. It wasn&#x2019;t for Sig. The trouble was that, unlike many of those with his quantitative background, Sig was a people person, too&#x2014;ï¿½a humanist. &#x201c;The stereotype of the introverted analyst? I guess I don&#x2019;t fit it so well,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>In the early 1990s, he realized that he was spending much of every weekend standing in line at Macy&#x2019;s, waiting to get another gift wrapped to tote to the weddings to which he kept being invited. He began to keep track of them. A quarter century later he had attended 96. That he knew the precise number was itself remarkable&#x2014;ï¿½only someone who quantifies everything would keep count&#x2014;ï¿½but so is the number itself. How many of us are so invested in people and relationships that 96 couples couldn&#x2019;t imagine observing their happiest of days without us there? His greatest regret, as he got older, was that the frequency of invitations slowed down.<br><br>His tasks at NASA, like the sleep cycle research, were more satisfying. He had studied cognitive psychology in graduate school because he was fascinated not by dry engineering problems like how to keep a rocket on course, but by how math and science intersected with people, how they could help humans understand and overcome their natural limitations. Still, NASA was just a job, too. He had always maxed out his vacation days at Lockheed, and at NASA he insisted on working on short-ï¿½term contracts so that for a month or two each year he could pursue another passion: travel. He called it &#x201c;high-ï¿½concentrate living,&#x201d; in his value-ï¿½focused way.<br><br>Seeking out adventure, he met people throughout Europe and South America. In 2001, he published an article in the Los Angeles Times, headlined &#x201c;Climbing the Stairway to Heaven,&#x201d; in which he chronicled his experiences as the novice member of an expedition that ascended Mount Chimborazo. Sig mischievously asserted that, factoring in Earth&#x2019;s ellipsoid shape, the Ecuadorean peak was actually its highest, 7,000 feet farther from the planet&#x2019;s center than Everest&#x2019;s. &#x201c;To the south I could see the mountains of Peru; to the west, the blues of the Pacific Ocean; and to the north, snowcapped Cotopaxi,&#x201d; he wrote of the vista from the hypoxemic summit. &#x201c;I was overwhelmed by the magnitude of what my eyes could take in. Exhaustion and emotion are a volatile combination for an oxygen-ï¿½starved brain. Some climbers collapsed in the snow. Some cried. Others hugged. I did a little of each before turning my attention to the view before me, the view from the top of the world.&#x201d;<br><br>After that, it was back down to the lab, where he continued to dream of a job that would unite his mathematical expertise with his passion for figuring out what made humans their best selves, a job in which he wouldn&#x2019;t feel as if each year amounted to working for 11 months in order to live for one.<br><br>Two years after Chimborazo, he thought he&#x2019;d found it.<br><br>Sig was 37 when, in 2003, he read Michael Lewis&#x2019;s Moneyball, a book that described how people with his skill set in the Oakland Athletics&#x2019; front office were reimagining the underpinnings of baseball by harnessing the power of data to take advantage of inefficiencies in the evaluation of players. They were, in other words, making a living by using math to get better at the thing he&#x2019;d always loved most. While he had remained an engaged fan and a member of SABR, he now realized there might be a place inside the game for someone like him. &#x201c;I thought, hey, that job would be better than NASA,&#x201d; he said.</p><h2>Practical Religion (Unabridged)</h2><p>&#x201c;Practical Religion,&#x201d; or &#x201c;walking the walk,&#x201d; is a very popular theme in evangelical circles today. What isn&#x2019;t spoken of as frequently is the fact that believers must KNOW what they believe. J. C. Ryle deftly walks the line between Systematic and Practical theologies, constantly forcing the reader to stop and examine his/her own life. Ryle&#x2019;s goal was to encourage strong and serious Christian living, and his wise comments are as relevant today as when he first wrote them. An important and interesting aspect of `Practical Religion' is the variety of subjects considered. There is an extremely encouraging chapter on zeal where Ryle masterfully demonstrates how zeal is important for the individual and the church in general. Ryle points out how God seems to honor the grace of zeal. He also gives some historical examples of zealous men that God has used mightily and whose influence exceeded those who were more gifted intellectually and perhaps in other ways as well. Powerful practical applications abound in each chapter of &#x201c;Practical Religion.&#x201d; In `Riches and Poverty' the danger and soul-ruining sin of selfishness is exposed. Christ died for those who should not henceforth live unto themselves and Ryle draws the thoroughly biblical conclusion from the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, that if we like the rich man live only for ourselves, we will come to eternal ruin. In the chapter entitled `Charity' which in modern language would be called love, Ryle describes what love is not, briefly explains what Christian love is, and insightfully points out why charity is called the greatest of the graces. Other topics Ryle manages to address fully include self-inquiry, the temptations of the world, eternity, formality, prayer, going to the table (communion), and Bible reading&#x2014;all with the power and spiritual richness that his writings are noted for. Those who take time to read and consider fascinating treatise on &#x201c;Practical Religion&#x201d; will be glad that they did.</p><p>John Charles Ryle (1816-1900) was the first Anglican bishop of Liverpool. Ryle was born at Macclesfield, and was educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he was Craven Scholar in 1836. After holding a curacy at Exbury in Hampshire, he became rector of St Thomas's, Winchester (1843), rector of Helmingham, Suffolk (1844), vicar of Stradbroke (1861), honorary canon of Norwich (1872), and dean of Salisbury (1880). However before taking the latter office, he was advanced to the new see of Liverpool, where he remained until his resignation, which took place three months before his death at Lowestoft. His appointment to Liverpool was at the recommendation of the outgoing Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Ryle was a strong supporter of the evangelical school and a critic of Ritualism. He was a writer, pastor and an evangelical preacher. Among his longer works are Christian Leaders of the Eighteenth Century (1869), Expository Thoughts on the Gospels (7 vols, 1856&#x2013;69), Principles for Churchmen (1884). Ryle was an athlete who rowed and played Cricket for Oxford, where he took a first class degree in Greats and was offered a college fellowship (teaching position) which he declined. The son of a wealthy banker, he was destined for a career in politics before choosing a path of ordained ministry. While hearing Ephesians 2 read in church in 1838, he felt a spiritual awakening and was ordained by Bishop Sumner at Winchester in 1842. For 38 years he was a parish vicar, first at Helmingham and later at Stradbrooke, in Suffolk. He became a leader of the evangelical party in the Church of England and was noted for his doctrinal essays and polemical writings. In 1880, at age 64, he became the first bishop of Liverpool, at the recommendation of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. He retired in 1900 at age 83 and died later the same year. He is buried in the All Saints' Church, Childwall, Liverpool. In his diocese, he formed a clergy pension fund for his diocese and built over forty churches. Controversially, he emphasized raising clergy salaries ahead of building a cathedral for his new diocese. Ryle was described as having a commanding presence and vigorous in advocating his principles albeit with a warm disposition. He was also credited with having success in evangelizing the blue collar community.&#39;&#39;The best man in the Church of England.&#39;&#39; --C. H.

It wasn&#x2019;t the retro look of the office furnishings or the dï¿½cor, or even the fashions, though they helped. It was the background chorus of a hundred electric typewriters clicking away.<br><br><i>Mad Men</i>&#x2019;s obsessive attention to period detail also extends to its food: what its characters eat and drink, how they eat and drink it, and where. We grew up in the 1960s just a few miles from Manhattan, so many of the foods and kitchen and restaurant scenes brought back childhood memories. When we saw Betty Draper serve Turkey Tetrazzini and stuffed celery, or Carla, the Draper&#x2019;s housekeeper, serve potato salad it was as if we had been transported back to our mothers&#x2019; kitchens. When the Draper kids watch Don break out another bottle of Canadian Club or the neighbors come over for bridge night, it reminded us of nights we&#x2019;d sneak halfway down the stairs in our pajamas to take a peak at our parents and their friends enjoying cocktails and cards.<br><br>Judy has a long track record pairing food and literature in two previous cookbooks she co-authored, which naturally extended to curiosity about the food in <i>Mad Men</i>. But when friends learned we were writing a <i>Mad Men</i>-themed cookbook, many were surprised: there was <i>food</i>? All they seemed to remember was a lot of drinking, and maybe Betty making breakfast or dinner in her kitchen.<br><br>But there is plenty of food and drink in <i>Mad Men</i>. Sometimes it&#x2019;s front and center, but often it&#x2019;s a background detail, the visual equivalent of those clicking typewriters, but a detail that lends great authenticity. Think of Don and Roger Sterling&#x2019;s power lunch at The Grand Central Oyster Bar; Don and Bobbi Barrett&#x2019;s intimate dinner conversation while waiting for their Steak Tartare at Sardi&#x2019;s; and the buffet tables laden with holiday treats the staff dances past at the Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce Christmas Party. When you saw Joan Harris&#x2019;s Hawaiian-themed New Year&#x2019;s Eve repast, or Betty&#x2019;s Around the World Dinner, didn&#x2019;t you want to pull up a chair?<br><br>Our goal was to create a cookbook with recipes for food and drink that either appears in <i>Mad Men</i>, or was served in the 1960s by the bars and restaurants featured in the show. We were delighted by the eagerness of many of those establishments to contribute recipes and photographs to this book. For example, since Don and Roger Sterling ate there, The Grand Central Oyster Bar&#x2019;s recipe for Oysters Rockefeller has changed: but thanks to owner and executive chef Sandy Ingber we&#x2019;ve been able include the version they would have been served. Sometimes tried and true recipes have survived the past half-century: the Caesar Salad at Keens Steakhouse remains the same, as does Sardi&#x2019;s Steak Tartar. Occasionally, we had to go digging for information on a cocktail or dish no longer on the menu at all: the Beverly Hills Hotel identified and sent us the recipe for a cocktail Pete Campbell sips poolside as a Royal Hawaiian, a cocktail they haven&#x2019;t served since the 1960s. There are times when we aren&#x2019;t shown what the characters are eating, as is the case when Don and Bethany Van Nuys dine at the elegant Barbetta restaurant near Times Square. Barbetta owner Laura Maioglio contributed two recipes that were on the menu in the early 1960s and which Don and Bethany might have enjoyed.<br><br>We also wanted to remain true to how the food and drink we selected would have been prepared in the early 1960s, though we did occasionally use an appliance first introduced in the early 1970s: a food processor.<br><br>Period authenticity becomes even more delicious when you have some historical context on the side information about the restaurants, hotels, foods, chefs, and real-life personalities that feature in Mad Men or that shaped the culinary landscape of the times. For example, Beef Wellington was a favorite of President and Mrs. Kennedy, and their White House once served Avocado Mimosas at a State Dinner for the President of Pakistan in 1961. There are recipes here for both. We explore how public fascination with the 50th state, Hawaii, translated not just into the Hula Hoop craze and singer Don Ho&#x2019;s stardom, but the popularity of Polynesian-themed restaurants, cocktails and foods and include recipes for several of them. And you can&#x2019;t fully appreciate the presence of French restaurants and cuisine in Mad Men without understanding the revolution in American culinary tastes spawned by the 1961 publication of Julia Child&#x2019;s <i>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</i> (Alfred A. Knopf).<br><br>We pored over hundreds of cookbooks, magazines, and advertisements from the 1950s and 1960s in our pursuit of information and ideas. To be true to the era, we looked for cookbooks the characters might have used. When Joan Harris (formerly Holloway) made that crown roast in her tiny kitchen to serve at a dinner party, we turned to <i>The Small Kitchen Cookbook</i> by Nina Mortellito (Walker and Company, 1964) for a recipe. When Pete Campbell asks his new wife to make rib-eye in the pan, we thought a logical cookbook selection for Trudy cooking for her ad man&#x201d; would have been <i>The Madison Avenue Cookbook</i> by Alan Koehler (Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1962).<br><br>Those cookbooks and magazines took us back to the 1960s and not only helped us choose and develop recipes, but enhanced our appreciation of how various food-related chores and even the different cocktails men and women favored tended to be gender specific.<br><br>Which brings us to those cocktails. There are times when Sterling Cooper might aptly be renamed the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (minus the firearms, though who knows <i>what</i> Bert Cooper keeps in his desk). The establishments frequented by Don Draper and his colleagues provided many of the cocktails for this book. For example, the recipes for a Sidecar and a Vesper come courtesy of P.J. Clarke&#x2019;s where Peggy Olson and others from Sterling Cooper celebrate her early copywriting success, and the Manhattan from The Oak Bar where Don and Roger sometimes stopped for a drink.<br><br>To ensure an authentic <i>Mad Men</i> experience every recipe is introduced through a specific scene in the show. And to enhance your enjoyment of the food and drink we scoured period cookbooks and magazines for tips on throwing a successful cocktail or dinner party. We also compiled a small guide to some of the restaurants and bars frequented by <i>Mad Men</i> characters. On your next trip to New York stop by and tell them Don sent you.<br><br>We, and a small army of volunteer recipe testers, cracked hundreds of eggs, baked at least a hundred pounds of butter and sugar into various pies and cakes, and poured gallons of gin, vodka and whiskey as we tested and retested recipes for this book (even when some didn&#x2019;t <i>need</i> retesting). We carved Crown Roasts and hams, shucked dozens of oysters and peeled pounds of potatoes, too. So, we can vouch for both the authenticity and the tastiness of the food and drink on these pages. Whether you like to cook, eat, drink, or simply enjoy devouring all things <i>Mad Men</i>, our hope is that this book will enhance your appreciation of the show and enrich your understanding of the times in which it is set.<br><br> Judy Gelman and Peter Zheutlin</p><h2>Sand Cake (A Frank Asch Bear Book)</h2><p>Baby Bear and his daddy &#x201c;bake&#x201d; a treat on the beach in this reissue of a classic picture book from celebrated and award-winning author and illustrator Frank Asch.<br><br>On a family trip to the beach, Baby Bear asks Papa Bear, &#x201c;If I make you a cake, will you eat it?&#x201d; Papa Bear agrees, but he wants Baby Bear to use ingredients like flour, milk, and eggs.

The Tyndale New Testament Commentaries have long been a trusted resource for Bible study. Written by some of the world&#39;s most distinguished evangelical scholars, these twenty volumes offer clear, reliable, and relevant explanations of every book in the New Testament. These Tyndale volumes are designed to help readers understand what the Bible actually says and what it means. The introduction to each volume gives a concise but thorough description of the authorship, date, and historical background of the biblical book under consideration. The commentary itself examines the text section by section, drawing out its main themes. It also comments on individual verses and deals with problems of interpretation. The aim throughout is to get at the true meaning of the Bible and to make its message plain to readers today. The original, unrevised text of this volume has been completely retypeset and printed in a larger, more attractive format with the new cover design for the series.</p><p>Wayne A. Grudem is research professor of Bible and theology at Phoenix Seminary, Scottsdale, Arizona."The Tyndale volumes have long been the premier shorter-length commentary series on both Testaments throughout the English-speaking world." (Craig Blomberg, Denver Seminary)<br><br>"Tyndale commentaries are always useful, not least because they focus so clearly on the text of Scripture, and do not fall into the trap of paying too much attention to other commentaries and not enough to the scriptural text they are intended to expound and explain. So they retain their usefulness for preachers, Bible study leaders and for all readers of the Bible." (Peter Adam, principal, Ridley College, Melbourne, Australia)<br><br>"Within its constraints, this series includes some outstanding volumes." (D. A. Carson, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"There simply is no series of medium-length commentaries that approaches the excellence of the Tyndale commentaries." (Donald A. Hagner, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"The evenness and quality of this series are remarkable." (Christianity Today)</p><h2>Forgiving Others: The Key to Healing and Deliverance</h2><p>We cannot begin to imagine the High Cost of Unforgiveness in our relationship with Jesus. Unforgiveness: - robs us of Gods forgiveness (Matt. 6:15, Mark 11:25, Luke 6:37) - shuts Gods ears to our prayers (Mark 11:24 25) - gives Satan an advantage (2 Cor. 2:10 11) - binds us to the one we despise. We just can t get them out of our heads, right? Every follower of Jesus needs to get this poison out of their soul. Here, in this book, is Hope. Jesus wants to set us free from the poison of unforgiveness. When we understand how much we have been forgiven, then we understand true thankfulness. The Lord longs to heal the wounds of our heart, and to restore our emotions and minds. The key to unlock this kind of intense healing is genuine, heartfelt forgiveness. The power and the might of the Holy Spirit can conquer any wall or barrier we have built around us. Jesus takes great delight in setting us free!</p><p>Frank Hammond was a graduate of Baylor University and Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary with over forty years experience as a pastor and teacher in the Body of Christ.

The porcupine smells rain in the air. The zebras see lightning. The baboons hear thunder. The rhino feels the first drops. And the lion tastes the cool water.

She tells the zebras, who SEE the rain coming and gallop off to tell the baboons. The baboons HEAR the rain coming. The rhino FEELS it. And the lion TASTES the rain. All the animals use their senses to predict the change of weather. Soon, the sky opens and it rains and rains and rains until every river gushes and gurgles. When it stops, green buds and grasses sprout and the animals find shelter in the shade of the big leaves and the cool, squelchy mud and relish the "fresh, juicy fruit from the trees" and long, refreshing drinks from the water hole. <p> Manya Stojic's exuberant picture book celebrates nature's sometimes extreme but always magical methods in madness.

Here are the stories that speak of a special nostalgia for Green Town, Illinois, the perfect setting for a seemingly cloudless childhood&#x2014;except for the unknown terror lurking in the ravine. Here are the Irish stories and the Mexican stories, linked across their separate geographies by Bradbury&#x2019;s astonishing inventiveness. Here, too, are thrilling, terrifying stories&#x2014;including &#x201c;The Veldt&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Fog Horn&#x201d;&#x2014;perfect for reading under the covers.<br><br>Read for the first time, these stories become as unshakable as one&#x2019;s own fantasies. Read again&#x2014;and again&#x2014;they reveal new, dazzling facets of the extraordinary art of Ray Bradbury.</p><p><i>The Stories of Ray Bradbury</i>--a hundred of his best stories, selected by the author himself--is the definitive collection of one of the greatest fantasists the world has ever known. Published in 1980, the volume contains stories selected from the first four decades of Bradbury's career. There are his unique stories of Mars, which later landed in <i>The Martian Chronicles</i>. There are nostalgic stories of Green Town, Illinois, which Bradbury later brewed into <i>Dandelion Wine</i>. The treasures here also include his regional tales of Ireland and of rural Mexico, classic science fiction such as "The Fog Horn," and the rarely reprinted novella "Frost and Fire." Among the half dozen previously uncollected stories are a few of his earliest--and most terrifying. These include the unforgettable "October Game" (which the author regards as perhaps his most shocking story amongst the thousand that he's written), and "Black Ferris," later to be transformed into the classic <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes</i>. Bradbury also contributes a revealing and highly informative look back at his own career. If you can possess only one book by the legendary Ray Bradbury, this is it. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i><b>Ray Bradbury </b>has published more than five hundred works, including <i>The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, Fahrenheit 451, </i>and <i>Something Wicked This Way Comes. </i>He was awarded the National Medal of Arts in 2004, and the National Book Foundation&#x2019;s Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters in 2000.

She has appeared with everyone from Billy Graham to Garth Brooks, sells out most concerts on her schedule, and has made the list of largest touring audiences in most entertainment magazines.<br><br>She is the author of eight books, including <i>I Can See Myself in His Eyeballs</i> and <i>It's Always Darkest before the FUN Comes Up,</i> and eight comedy videos, such as Four-Eyed Blonde, Have I Got a Story for You! and A Piece of My Mind. Chonda is also a spokesperson for World Vision and president of the Christian Comedy Association. She resides in middle Tennessee with her husband, David, and their two children.<b>Chapter One:</b> The Big Crash<p></p><p>In a very roundabout way, this journey begins in a remote, exotic setting on a small island off the coast of Mexico. And you know the saying: What happens in Mexico doesn't stay in Mexico. Or is it the other way around?</p><p></p><p>Anyway, there I was in Cozumel, Mexico, with my family just for the day. When you're on a cruise you can do that -- hop off at a port in one country, spend the day buying monkey heads made out of coconut shells, hop to the next country, spend the day buying pocketbooks made from coconut shells, hop to the next and -- well, you get the picture. </p><p></p><p>We were in Cozumel with a gaggle of other Christian artists like Rebecca St. James, Mark Shultz, the guys and gals from FFH and Avalon, and various agents and promoters. Someone had the great idea that instead of shopping for coconut clothing, coconut furniture, and coconut lamps, we could ride mopeds across the island, have a quaint lunch at a secluded cafï¿½ -- away from all the tourists -- and then moped back.</p><p></p><p>"Wow!" my husband and children said. "That sounds like fun!"</p><p></p><p>Me? I had my heart set on the coconut salt and pepper shakers. But I got outvoted, and off we went on our rented mopeds.</p><p></p><p>The trip started out just like I'd imagine the brochure would promise (had there been a brochure). Sunny, sandy, tropical. A gorgeous shoreline that would take your breath away (but then again, so would an errant bug down the windpipe). What no one told us, however -- and the reason there probably was no brochure -- is that for most of the trip, we were going to have to share the road with all the normal traffic. All the normal, speeding traffic.</p><p></p><p>Jeff Allen is a fellow comedian who hates to shop, so he'd talked his wife into the moped jaunt (is that the right word?). At the halfway point she careened into a ravine and nearly broke her leg. Another woman did -- break her leg, that is. And another woman, one who was putt-putt-putting along just ahead of me, simply drove off into the swamp. It was like she never even tried to turn. I was afraid I'd just witnessed suicide-by-moped.</p><p></p><p>My husband and son stopped and helped pull her out of the muck. She was scratched up a bit, but otherwise fine. I still don't know her name. To this day I call her "the-lady-who-almost-died-on-a-moped." But then, there is a busload of people who probably know me only by that name as well. Yes, I too nearly got creamed on a moped. </p><p></p><p>Mopeds are strange animals. Ours were so old and rickety that you had to aim to the left to make the front wheels go in a straight line. Therefore, a right-hand turn was almost impossible. I know because I risked it. And I risked it because a city bus was coming at me head-on. I needed to turn and turn fast. I'd take a swamp over a city bus any day!</p><p></p><p>Now, I was no stranger to "the hog." I'd driven a motorcycle in high school. I know what it feels like to hop on 80cc's of raw power. I'd also learned in high school (besides the fact that it's totally impossible to miss a chicken that decides to cross the road in front of you) that if you jerk the front wheel of a motorcycle with all your might, something will happen.</p><p></p><p>So I turned hard, just as I felt city-bus metal brush against the sleeve of my jacket. <i>So this is how it ends,</i> I remember thinking. Smashed by the <i>Ocho Nueve in Cozumel, Mexico.</i> (That's Bus Number 89 for those of you who don't speak Spanish. And for those of you who do, I won't repeat what I heard coming from the people inside the bus.)</p><p></p><p>I yanked the moped onto the grass and came to a dusty halt. And then I cried. Hard. When I finished, I slowly putt-putted myself back to town and spent the rest of the day buying coconut souvenirs for people I hadn't thought about in years. A near-death experience will do that to you.</p><p></p><p>So thanks to my motorcycle expertise and, no doubt, a whole host of guardian angels, I avoided a nasty crash in a faraway land. What I didn't know at the time was that wiping out on a moped in Cozumel was a breeze compared to the big crash that awaited me in Miami a couple of weeks later.</p><p></p><p>I told you my almost-got-killed-on-a-moped story so that when I explain how I left the cruise ship (it was work, mind you), raced home, did some laundry, and headed back out to a swanky hotel and spa in Miami, you won't hate me. The Miami thing had been planned for a while. You see, I'd held a contest months earlier for my Turbo Host of the Year. (The contestants were the volunteers who helped organize my concerts in each of the towns I visited.) The winner was a sweet young woman named Melanie. The prize? My girlfriends and I took her to be pampered, because that's what girlfriends do when there's a trip to a spa in Miami on the schedule! We chose Super Bowl Sunday for our trip because we knew there'd be no pampering at home; most of our husbands would be too engrossed in the Big Game.</p><p></p><p>I was especially tired that weekend. And I had an upset stomach -- but hey, I had almost been killed in Mexico. Which was another reason to sign up for the Pamper Package: massage, facial, pedicure, manicure, and half a dozen other things that end in cure or massage.</p><p></p><p>Our luxurious beachside accommodations were on the fifteenth floor of the hotel, overlooking the beautiful Atlantic. The little soaps and shampoos in the basket in the bathroom were some kind of high-class rosemary mint stuff -- not your generic soap bars that never lather. Not here! Every liquid or gel at this place had a bit of "oo-la-la" mixed in -- the oils and the perfumes and the moisturizers and even the shoe polish. I didn't want to miss a single amenity. I tried a dab of every bottle, tube, bar, and squeeze pack in the place. (It gave me the same kind of excited feeling I used to get as a kid whenever the government cheese truck would roll through the neighborhood.) I used it all and smelled like a bouquet. Then I washed most of it off, scrubbing especially hard to remove the shoe polish from my wrists and behind my ears.</p><p></p><p>And then there was the spa! That first day we plopped into the hot tub, cooked in the sauna, and boiled in the Jacuzzi. We didn't miss a single body of water. I'm not sure if we were supposed to soak in that cute fountain thing in the foyer or not. (Don't worry, we didn't.) What made it all even better was that back home in Tennessee, it was snowing. Could we have asked for a more perfect weekend?</p><p></p><p>Well, maybe <i>perfect</i> isn't the best word. Like I told you, there was a big crash coming; I just didn't know it. And if you haven't guessed yet, it took place in mid-spa...</p><p></p><p><b>WHERE ARE THE PILLOW MINTS?</b></p><p></p><p>Late Saturday night, nearly two days into our fancy-schmancy pampering weekend, I got a sharp pain in my chest, and I couldn't take a deep breath. "That's okay," one of my friends said. "Just take lots of little breaths." That sounded like good, solid math to me. So I did. I took lots of short, shallow breaths, while my heart raced and panic tried to creep in.</p><p></p><p>"I know what we can do," someone else said. "Let's go to a fancy restaurant." And so we did, because that's what girlfriends do when they're on a fancy-schmancy pampering weekend. And that seemed to take care of the problem -- at least for a while.</p><p></p><p>The next morning I was still having a hard time breathing. I wondered if I was allergic to shoe polish. My girlfriends tried to get to the root of the problem. Someone started a list. Was it the Italian food from the night before? No it started before that. What about the donuts? No, donuts love me. The little mints on the pillows? ("Those <i>were</i> mints, weren't they, girls?" I remember asking.) How about the bag of bagels from the Mexican restaurant across the street? (I know, bagels at a Mexican restaurant? Don't ask!)</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, someone fired up the laptop and began surfing the Internet. We had seaweed wraps and moon-rock massages lined up for the afternoon, so we had to find a cure quick. You know, I have a feeling the Internet will soon be the number one "reason to see a doctor." Somewhere between beyourowndoctor.com and homeremedies-R-us.net (they're not real Web site names, but they'd be great ones, don't you think?), a girl could get killed. I sat on the couch, barely breathing, while the Spa Brigade asked me a battery of questions. After each question someone would move the mouse, and I'd hear a click. After about twenty minutes of pointing and clicking, my friends determined that either (1) I was having a heart attack, (2) I had developed a gallstone, or (3) I needed a lung transplant.</p><p></p><p>After two more point-and-clicks, someone offered another possibility. "Could be that you just crashed into menopause," she said. If it weren't for the fact that I couldn't breathe already, that would have taken my breath away. "You mean, I'm not going to be able to breathe again until I'm sixty-five?"</p><p></p><p>Another sharp pain hit me in the chest, and I began to feel faint. I fell back deeper into the sofa. The plush cushions of the fancy-schmancy hotel felt nice, but the pain in my chest was killing me. I prayed for gallstones.</p><p></p><p>One of the girls on our trip was my friend Alison. I call her Alison the Angel now. She's known me since before high school. She's seen me when I've been healthy and happy and when I've been tired and ill. She's seen me when I've been cranky and irritable and when I've been happy-go-lucky. She's even seen me skinny -- that's how far back we go. But she'd never seen me clutch my chest and fall back on a sofa.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, that's it," she said, moving to the center of the room and pointing a hairbrush as if she were a conductor with a baton. "Nicole, call the front desk and get a cab. Melanie, get Chonda's purse and find her driver's license and medical card. Michelle, dig out the Yellow Pages and find the nearest emergency room."</p><p></p><p>Everything was a blur after that -- that is, until we got to the emergency room. Then everything turned into a slow crawl. I waited for a few hours before finally settling into a bed in the ER (no pillow mints). I waited some more, and then someone wheeled me to x-ray so the doct...</p></p><h2>How to Find Love in a Bookshop: A Novel</h2><p><b>&#x201c;Absolutely delightful.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>People</i><br><br>The enchanting story of a bookshop, its grieving owner, a supportive literary community, and the extraordinary power of books to heal the heart</b>&nbsp;<br><br> Nightingale Books, nestled on the main street in an idyllic little village, is a dream come true for book lovers&#x2014;a cozy haven and welcoming getaway for the literary-minded locals.

That he&#x2019;d be standing in an empty shop with a baby in a pram, seriously considering putting in an offer.</i></p><p><i>The pram had been a stroke of luck. He&#x2019;d seen an advert for a garden sale in a posh part of North Oxford, and the bargain hunter in him couldn&#x2019;t stay away. The couple had two very young children but were moving to Paris. The pram was pristine, of the kind the queen might have pushed&#x2014;or, rather, her nanny. The woman had wanted only five pounds for it. Julius was sure it was worth far more, and that she was only being kind. But if recent events had taught him one thing, it was to accept kindness. With alacrity, before people changed their minds. So he bought it and scrubbed it out carefully even though it had seemed very clean already, and bought a fresh mattress and blankets, and there he had it: the perfect nest for his precious cargo, until she could walk.</i></p><p><i>When did babies start to walk? There was no point in asking Debra&#x2014;his vague, away</i>-<i>with</i>-<i>the</i>-<i>fairies mother, ensconced in her patchouli</i>-<i>soaked basement flat in Westbourne Grove, whose memory of his own childhood was blurry.</i></p><p><i>According to Debra, Julius was reading by the age of two, a legend he didn&#x2019;t quite believe. Although maybe it was true, because he couldn&#x2019;t remember a time he couldn&#x2019;t read. It was like breathing to him. Nevertheless, he couldn&#x2019;t and didn&#x2019;t rely on his mother for child-rearing advice. He often thought it was a miracle he had made it through childhood unscathed. She used to leave him alone, in his cot, while she went to the wine bar on the corner in the evenings. &#x201c;What could go wrong?&#x201d; she asked him. &#x201c;I only left you for an hour.&#x201d; Perhaps that explained his protectiveness toward his own daughter. He found it hard to turn his back on her for even a moment.</i></p><p><i>He looked around the bare walls again. The smell of damp was inescapable, and damp would be a disaster. The staircase rising to the mezzanine was rotten, so rotten he wasn&#x2019;t allowed up it. The two bay windows on either side of the front door flooded the shop with a pearlescent light, highlighting the golden oak of the floorboards and the ornate plasterwork on the ceiling. The dust made it feel otherworldly: a ghost shop, waiting, waiting for something to happen, a transformation, a renovation, a renaissance.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;It was a pharmacy, originally,&#x201d; said the agent. &#x201c;And then an antiques shop. Well, I say antique&#x2014;you&#x2019;ve never seen so much rubbish in your life.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>He should get some professional advice, really. A structural survey, a quote from someone for any work needed</i>&#x2014;<i>yet Julius felt light</i>-<i>headed and his heart was pounding. It was right. He knew it was. The two floors above were ideal for him and the baby to live in. Over the shop.</i></p><p><i>The bookshop.</i></p><p><i>His search had begun three weeks earlier, when he had decided that he needed to take positive action if he and his daughter were going to have any semblance of a normal life together. He had looked at his experience, his potential, his assets, and the practicalities of being a single father, and decided there was really only one option open to him.</i></p><p><i>He&#x2019;d gone to the library, put a copy of the Yellow Pages on the table, and next to it a detailed map of the county. He drew a circle around Oxford with a fifteen</i>-<i>mile radius, wondering what it would be like to live in Christmas Common, or Ducklington, or Goosey: they sounded straight out of Beatrix Potter. Then he worked through all the bookshops listed and put a cross through the towns they were in.</i></p><p><i>He looked at the remaining towns, the ones without a bookshop at all. There were half a dozen. He made a list, and then over the next few days visited each one, traveling by a complicated timetable of buses. The first three had been soulless and dreary, and he was so discouraged he&#x2019;d almost given up on his idea, but something about the name Peasebrook pleased him, so he decided to try one more town before relinquishing his fantasy.</i></p><p><i>Peasebrook was in the middle of the Cotswolds, on the outer perimeter of the circle he had drawn, as far out as he wanted to go. He got off the bus and looked up the high street. It was wide and tree</i> <i>lined, its pavements flanked with higgledy-piggledy golden buildings. There were antiques shops, a traditional butcher with rabbit and pheasant hanging outside and fat sausages in the window, a sprawling inn and a couple of nice cafï¿½s and a cheese shop. The Women&#x2019;s Institute was having a sale outside the town hall: there were trestle tables bearing big cakes oozing jam, and baskets of mud-covered vegetables and pots of herbaceous flowers drooping dark purple and yellow blooms.</i></p><p><i>Peasebrook was buzzing, in a quiet way but with purpose, like bees on a summer afternoon. People stopped in the street and talked to each other. The cafï¿½s looked pleasingly full. The tills seemed to jangle: people were shopping with gusto and enthusiasm. There was a very smart restaurant with a bay tree outside the door and an impressive menu in a glass case boasting nouvelle cuisine. There was even a tiny theater showing </i>The Importance of Being Earnest<i>. Somehow that boded well. Julius loved Oscar Wilde. He&#x2019;d done one of his dissertations on him: &#x201c;The Influence of Oscar Wilde on W. B. Yeats.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>He took the play as a good omen, but he carried on scouring the streets, in case his research hadn&#x2019;t been thorough. He feared turning a corner and finding what he hoped wasn&#x2019;t there. Now that he was here, in Peasebrook, he wanted it to be his home</i>&#x2014;their <i>home. It was a mystery, though, why there was no bookshop in such an appealing place.</i></p><p><i>After all, a town without a bookshop was a town without a heart.</i></p><p><i>Julius imagined each person he passed as a potential customer. He could picture them all, crowding in, asking his advice, him sliding their purchases into a bag, getting to know their likes and dislikes, putting a book aside for a particular customer, knowing it would be just up their alley. Watching them browse, watching the joy of them discovering a new author, a new world.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;Would the vendor take a cheeky offer?&#x201d; he asked the estate agent, who shrugged.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;You can ask.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;It needs a lot of work.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;That </i>has<i> been taken into consideration.&#x201d; Julius named his price.</i></p><p><i>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s my best and only offer. I can&#x2019;t afford any more.&#x201d;</i></p><p><i>When Julius signed the contract four weeks later, he couldn&#x2019;t help but be amazed. Here he was, alone in the world (well, there was his mother, but she was as much use as a chocolate teapot) but for a baby and a bookshop. And as that very baby reached out her starfish hand, he gave her his finger to hold and thought: what an extraordinary position to be in. Fate was peculiar indeed.</i></p><p><i>What if he hadn&#x2019;t looked up at that very moment, nearly two years ago now? What if he had kept his back to the door and carried on rearranging the travel section, leaving his colleague to serve the girl with the Rossetti hair . . .</i></p><p><i>And six months later, after weeks of dust and grime and sawing and sweeping and painting, and several eye-watering bills, and a few moments of sheer panic, and any number of deliveries, the sign outside the shop was rehung, painted in navy and gold, proclaiming </i>Nightingale Books<i>. There had been no room to write </i>purveyors of reading matter to the discerning<i>, but that was what he was. A bookseller.</i></p><p><i>A bookseller of the very best kind.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>1</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Thirty-two years later . . .</i></p><p>What do you do, while you&#x2019;re waiting for someone to die? Literally, sitting next to them in a plastic armchair that isn&#x2019;t the right shape for <i>anyone&#x2019;s </i>bottom, waiting for them to draw their last breath because there is no more hope.</p><p>Nothing seemed appropriate. There was a room down the corridor for watching TV, but that seemed callous, and anyway, Emilia wasn&#x2019;t really a TV person.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t knit, or do needlepoint. Or sudoku.</p><p>She didn&#x2019;t want to listen to music, for fear of disturbing him. Even the best earphones leak a certain timpani. Irritating on a train, probably even more so on your deathbed. She didn&#x2019;t want to surf the Internet on her phone. That seemed the ultimate in twenty-first-century rudeness.</p><p>And there wasn&#x2019;t a single book on the planet that could hold her attention right now.</p><p>So she sat next to his bed and dozed. And every now and then she started awake with a bolt of fear, in case she might have missed the moment. Then she would hold his hand for a few minutes. It was dry and cool and lay motionless in her clasp. Eventually it grew heavy and made her sad, so she laid it back on the top of the sheet.</p><p>Then she would doze off again.</p><p>From time to time the nurses brought her hot chocolate, although that was a misnomer. It was not hot, but tepid, and Emilia was fairly certain that no cocoa beans had been harmed in the making of it. It was pale beige, faintly sweet water.</p><p>The nighttime lights in the cottage hospital were dim, with a sickly yellowish tinge. The heating was on too high and the little room felt airless. She looked at the thin bedcover, with its pattern of orange and yellow flowers, and the outline of her father underneath, so still and small. She could see the few strands of hair curling over his scalp, leached of color. His thick hair had been one of his distinguishing features. He would rake his fingers through it while he was considering a recommendation, or when he was standing in front of one of the display tables trying to decide what to put on it, or when he was on the phone to a customer. It was as much a part of him as the pale blue cashmere scarf he insisted on wearing, wrapped twice round his neck, even though it bore evidence of moths. Emilia had dealt with them swiftly at the first sign. She suspected they had been brought in via the thick brown velvet coat she had bought at the charity shop last winter&#x2014;she could never resist a vintage bargain&#x2014; and she felt guilty they&#x2019;d set upon the one sartorial item her father seemed attached to.</p><p>He&#x2019;d been complaining then, of discomfort. Well, not complaining, because he wasn&#x2019;t one to moan. Emilia had expressed concern, and he had dismissed her concern with his trademark stoicism, and she had thought nothing more of it, just got on the plane to Hong Kong. Until the phone call, last week, calling her back.</p><p>&#x201c;I think you ought to come home,&#x201d; the nurse had said. &#x201c;Your father will be furious with me for calling you. He doesn&#x2019;t want to alarm you.&nbsp; But . . .&#x201d; The <i>but</i> said it all. Emilia was on the first flight out. And when she arrived Julius pretended to be cross, but the way he held her hand, tighter than tight, told her everything she needed to know.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s in denial,&#x201d; said the nurse. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a fighter, all right. I&#x2019;m so sorry. We&#x2019;re doing everything we can to keep him comfortable.&#x201d; Emilia nodded, finally understanding. Comfortable. Not alive.</p><p>Comfortable.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t seem to be in any pain or discomfort now. He had eaten some lime Jell-O the day before, eager for the quivering spoons of green. Emilia imagined it soothed his parched lips and dry tongue. She felt as if she was feeding a little bird as he stretched his neck to reach the spoon and opened his mouth. Afterward he lay back, exhausted by the effort. It was all he had eaten for days. All he was living on was a complicated cocktail of painkillers and sedatives that were rotated to provide the best palliative care. Emilia had come to hate the word <i>palliative</i>. It was ominous, and at times, she suspected, ineffectual. From time to time her father had shown distress, whether from pain or the knowledge of what was to come she couldn&#x2019;t be sure but she knew at those points the medication wasn&#x2019;t doing its job. Adjustment, although swiftly administered, never worked quickly enough. Which in turn caused her distress.</p><p>It was a never-ending cycle.</p><p>Yet not<i> never</i>-ending because it <i>would </i>end. The corner had been turned and there was no point in hoping for a recovery. Even the most optimistic believer in miracles would know that now. So there was nothing to do but pray for a swift and merciful release.</p><p>The nurse lifted the bedcover and looked at his feet, caressing them with gentle fingers. The look the nurse gave Emilia told her it wouldn&#x2019;t be long now.</p><p>His skin was pale gray, the pale gray of a marble statue.</p><p>The nurse dropped the sheet back down and rubbed Emilia&#x2019;s shoulder.</p><p>Then she left, for there was nothing she could say. It was a waiting game. They had done all they could. No pain, as far as anyone could surmise. A calm, quiet environment, for incipient death was treated with hushed reverence. But who was to say what the dying really wanted? Maybe he would prefer his beloved Elgar at full blast, or the shipping forecast on repeat? Or to hear the nurses gossiping and bantering, about whom they&#x2019;d been out with the night before and what they were cooking for tea? Maybe a distraction from your imminent demise by utter trivia would be a welcome one? Emilia sat and wondered how she could make him feel her love, as he slipped away. If she could take out her heart and give it to him, she would. This wonderful man who had given her life, and been her life, and was leaving her alone.</p><p>She&#x2019;d whispered to him, memories and reminiscences. She told him stories. Recited his favorite poems.</p><p>Talked to him about the shop.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to look after it for you,&#x201d; she told him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make sure it never closes its doors. Not in my lifetime. And I&#x2019;m never going to sell out to Ian Mendip, no matter what he offers, because the shop is all that matters. All the diamonds in the world are nothing in comparison. Books are more precious than jewels.&#x201d; She truly believed this. What did a diamond bring you? A momentary flash of brilliance. A diamond scintillated for a second; a book could scintillate forever.</p><p>She doubted Ian Mendip had ever read a book in his life. It made her so angry, thinking about the stress he&#x2019;d put her father under at a vulnerable time.</p><p>Julius had tried to underplay it, but she could see he was agitated, fearful for the shop and his staff and his customers. The staff had told her how unsettled he had been by it, and yet again she had cursed herself for being so far away. Now she was determined to reassure him, so he could slip away, safe in the knowledge that Nightingale Books was in good hands.</p><p>She shifted on the seat to find a more comfortable position. She ended up leaning forward and resting her head in her arms at the foot of the bed. She was unbelievably tired.</p><p>It was 2:49 in the morning when the nurse touched her on the shoulder. Her touch said everything that needed to be said. Emilia wasn&#x2019;t sure if she had been asleep or awake. Even now s...</p></p><h2>The Whirligig Maker&#39;s Book: Full-Size Patterns and Step-by-Step Instructions for Making Fifteen Unique Animated Whirligigs</h2><p>THE WHIRLIGIG MAKER&#39;S BOOK covers everything you need to know to get started in the craft and hobby of making animated whirligigs.

But all &#34;Brazelton babies&#34; grow up. Now at last, the internationally famous pediatrician, in collaboration with an eminent child psychiatrist, has brought his unique insights to the &#34;magic&#34; preschool and first-grade years.Through delightful profiles of four very different children, the authors apply the touchpoints theory (following the pattern of growth-new challenge-reegression-recharging-and renewed growth) to each of the great cognitive, behavioral, and emotional leaps that occur from age three to six. In the second, alphabetical, half of the book they offer precious guidance to parents facing contemporary pressures and stresses, such as how to keep a child safe without instilling fear, countering the electronic barrage of violent games and marketing aimed at children, coping successfully with varied family configurations, over-scheduling, competition, and many other vital issues today. A Merloyd Lawrence Book</p><p>Like a soothing tonic, <i>Touchpoints Three to Six</i> offers a simple theory and plenty of sound advice to parents who struggle with their child's ever-changing moods and behaviors. Noted pediatrician T. Berry Brazelton, M.D., bestselling author of <i>Infants and Mothers</i> and <i>Touchpoints</i>, builds on his theory that kids essentially "rev up" prior to reaching developmental milestones (like walking, talking, and potty training). Unfortunately for the whole family, such revving typically involves temper tantrums, night waking, and regression. Teaming with child psychiatrist Joshua D. Sparrow, M.D., Dr. Brazelton offers compassionate suggestions for recognizing key touchpoints in children 3 to 6 years old, helping kids work through them, and keeping one's cool throughout the process. <p> The first four chapters--one per age--provide fairly exhaustive study material on five topics: temperament, learning, moral development, building relationships, and separation and independence. To make the reading more engaging, Brazelton and Sparrow whip up four imaginary children, each with a distinct temperament, learning ability, and level of adaptability. Their shared experiences--from exploring the playground at age 3 to "entering the real world" during their 6th year--provide a helpful backdrop for discussing a myriad of pertinent issues. Smart dialogue, accurate depiction of parents' emotional responses, and surprise discoveries both amusing and serious all add to the breadth of information covered. The second half of the book offers about 200 pages of alphabetically arranged "perennials" and "current issues," for troubleshooting specifics like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, computers, divorce, habits, sadness, and toilet learning. An excellent resource for those who support empathetic parenting. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p><b>T.

It feels as if &#x201c;doing your best&#x201d; is never enough to please everyone, and the demands mothers place on themselves are both impossible and unrealistic. Now Meg Meeker, M.D., critically acclaimed author of&nbsp;<i>Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters,</i>&nbsp;puts her twenty-five years&#x2019; experience as a practicing pediatrician and counselor into a sound, sane approach to reshaping the frustrating, exhausting lives of so many moms. &nbsp;<br><br>Mothers are expected to do it all: raise superstar kids, look great, make good salaries, volunteer for everything, run errands, keep a perfect house, be the perfect wife. Single mothers often have even more demands&#x2014;and less support. In this rallying cry for change, Dr. Meeker incorporates clinical data and her own experience raising four children to show why mothers suffer from the rising pressure to excel and the toll it takes on their emotional, physical, mental, and spiritual health. Too many mothers are increasingly lonely, anxious, depressed, and unhappy with themselves, refusing to let themselves off the hook. Here, Dr. Meeker has identified the 10 most positive habits of mothers who are healthy, happy, and fulfilled. The key is to embrace a new perspective and create real joy and purpose by utilizing such core habits as<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>ï¿½ making friends with those who know the meaning of friendship<br>ï¿½ finding out what money can buy (and what it cannot)<br>ï¿½ lightening the overload&#x2014;and doing less more often<br>ï¿½ discovering faith and learning how to trust it<br>ï¿½ taking some alone time and reviving yourself<br>&nbsp;<br>Mothers, it&#x2019;s time to view the unconditional trust that you see in your children&#x2019;s eyes when they take your hand or find your face in a crowd as a mirror of your own wonder and worth. You are the light that shines in their lives, the beacon that guides them. By implementing the key strategies in Dr. Meeker&#x2019;s book, you can be happy, hopeful, and a wonderful role model. You can teach your children to be the very best they can be&#x2014;and isn&#x2019;t that still the most precious reward of motherhood?</p></p><p><b>A Q&amp;A with Dr. Meg Meeker, Author of <i>The Ten Habits of Happy Mothers</i></b> <br> <p></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <b>Q: Your book <i>Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters</i> received very positive critical acclaim and was a national bestseller. Why did you decide to shift your focus to mothers?</b><br> <b>A:</b> I decided to write on mothers for two reasons. First, after I saw the overwhelmingly positive response to the encouragement I gave fathers in <i>Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters</i>, I realized that there is a huge paucity of encouragement out there not just for fathers, but for mothers too. Second, over the past 25 years, I have witnessed a shift in the level of stress that all mothers feel. I believe (and research supports this) that mothers are more stressed today than they have ever been. I wanted to drill down and find the sources of the stress and offer solutions to mothers in a positive, encouraging way. I also learned one extremely important lesson very early on as a pediatrician: if I really want to keep kids emotionally and physically happy, the best thing I can do for them is help their mothers. Once she's happy, I didn't need to worry about the kids.) <p></p> <b>Q: This new book discusses ten essential habits that mothers should abide by to reclaim the passion, purpose and sanity in their lives. How did you come up with these specific habits--were any of them based on your own personal experience as a mother? </b><br> <b>A:</b> I comprised a list of "habits" for mothers after I identified the key stressors in mothers' lives. For instance, I found that money, feeling overwhelmed with complicated schedules, and fear that they weren't parenting well enough were some key stressors. These habits counter those key stresses. Since there isn't much research available on mothers' attitudes toward fear or competitiveness, for instance, much of my advice comes from years of listening intently to the mothers I see in my practice. <p></p> <b>Q: Why is solitude so important to mothers these days.</b><br> <b>A:</b> Solitude is extremely important for several reasons. First, as mothers, we are continually bombarded with another person's needs and demands. In order to stay sane, we need a reprieve from these. Also, we need solitude so that we can spend reflective time on deeper, important issues such as: what do we want from our lives, what is our purpose and what do we really want for our kids? Finally, solitude teaches us to learn to enjoy our own company. This cannot be understated because every mother needs to learn to like herself and like being with herself. Only solitude affords this. <p></p> <b>Q: Whether you are a single mother or in a happy relationship, you assert that it is so important for women to form friendships with other women. Why?</b><br> <b>A:</b> Mothers need other women friends because one of our primary needs is to be in deep relationship with a few close people. Our kids cannot serve this need and our husbands can only do so to a certain extent. We mothers need women friends because women think like we do, they stick with us when others leave us and they love us in ways that many husbands, family members or children can't. <p></p> <b>Q: There are a lot of advice books for parents on the market. What makes your approach to parenting and motherhood different?</b><br> <b>A:</b> My approach to parenting has always been to start where you are and move forward. Many parents ruminate on their mistakes and this prohibits them from becoming better parents and from enjoying parenting more. Mothers, in particular, beat themselves up so much for past mistakes and I always encourage mothers to look forward, not back. This book, is the <i>only</i> book I have ever seen that is written for mothers, not to be better parents, but to learn how to enjoy parenting once again. And I <i>know</i> that any mother can enjoy her role as a mother more! <p></p><p><b>Meg Meeker, M.D.,</b> is the author of<i> Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters</i> and <i>Boys Should Be Boys</i>.

Greg deconstructs pop culture, media, kids, disease, race, food, sex, celebrity, current events, and nearly every other aspect of life, with Truths including but not limited to: "if you're over 25 and still use <em>party</em> as a verb, then you're beyond redemption," "the media wanted bird flu to kill thousands," "attractive people don't write for a living," "death row inmates make the best husbands," and "the urge to punch Zach Braff in the face is completely natural."<br><br>With an irreverent voice, incredible wit, and a firm take on just about everything, this is a manual for how to think about stuff, by a guy who has thought about precisely that same stuff.

Carson,</strong>&nbsp;Emeritus Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School; Cofounder, The Gospel Coalition</p><p>"How does the church construct its doctrine of Jesus Christ? Biblicism collects the many verses about Christ and develops a doctrine about his person and work without an overarching framework. Liberalism seeks to paint a nontraditional portrait of Jesus in order to engage with some contemporary issue or to promote a specific political agenda. Experientialism picks and chooses concepts about Jesus that conform to and confirm its idyllic vision of him. Wellum rejects these approaches and offers the church a Christology that is at once biblical, historically grounded, philosophically astute, theologically robust, covenantal, canonical, confessional, and devotional. Often as I read <em>God the Son Incarnate</em>, I had to pause to worship the God-man presented in its pages. This book is absolutely brilliant!"<br>&#x2015;<strong>Gregg R.

In this substantial, perceptive, and faithful volume, the doctrine of Christ is ably situated in the biblical story, grounded in biblical theology, related to the historical and contemporary context, and synthesized via systematic theology. The result is that pastors, students, and church leaders alike will mature in their understanding and appreciation of Jesus&#x2019;s life, deity, humanity, unity, and identity."<br>&#x2015;<strong>Christopher W. Morgan,</strong> Dean and Professor of Theology, California Baptist University; editor, Theology in Community series; coeditor, <em>ESV Systematic Theology Study Bible</em></p><p>"Good theology depends on good methodology, and here Wellum is second to none. After establishing a philosophical backdrop, Wellum employs exegesis, biblical theology, and historical theology to draw out systematic conclusions that apply Scripture to life. And all our doctrine, he observes, prepares us for Christology or is inferred from it. The theology and life of the church makes sense only when centered on Christ, who is God the Son incarnate, the fulfillment of divine desire and the hope of humanity.

Well, the truth was, frosting wouldn&#x2019;t take long, but I wanted to wash and set my hair in my mom&#x2019;s big rollers before I went to the bridal salon. I would be modeling today for Mona&#x2019;s clients, and I wanted to try a new hairstyle and see what everyone at the shop thought.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s kind of crazy how I started modeling for Mona. One Saturday morning I was making a regular cupcake delivery to the store (my friends and I in the Cupcake Club have a cupcake business, and Mona buys cupcakes from us for her Saturday brides each week), and an important mystery client was there for an early showing of dresses. It turned out to be Romaine Ford, our only hometown celebrity, and I ended up modeling junior bridesmaid dresses for her because there was no one else available. Meeting Romaine Ford and everything that came after that was the most exciting part of my life yet.<br> <br>Since then, I&#x2019;ve been modeling for Mona about once or twice a month for trunk shows, which is when specialty designers bring in their line for the day. It&#x2019;s fun. I get to dress up and sometimes have my hair styled (no makeup, though! It could ruin the dresses!) and hang out in a totally girlie environment for the morning, away from my three smelly brothers. Best of all, Mona pays me.<br> <br>So this morning I showered, then put on my fancy jeans and a pretty turtleneck sweater, some tiny pearl stud earrings, and a belt. Then I rolled my hair and forgot all about it for a while as I finished up the cupcakes. Well, until my brother Matt walked into the kitchen and fell down on the floor laughing. I guess I looked pretty funny with my hair all in rollers, but there are times like these when I really wish I had a sister. Anyway, it only took about half an hour to frost and pack the cupcakes since they&#x2019;re minis, which are not much wider than a quarter. Mona loves them. Brides are always on diets, so they&#x2019;re hungry, which makes them cranky. These cupcakes are so tiny, no one can resist, and she says they make cranky brides friendlier. Isn&#x2019;t that funny?<br> <br>Afterward, I ran the blow-dryer over my curlers to really set my hair, then I unpinned the rollers and swung my head from side to side. My hair is a very yellow blond on top, from the sun, but underneath it&#x2019;s a much darker shade. The curls made the colors all swirly and mixed together, and the style gave me a lot of height. I looked two inches taller! I laughed at the sight of it. It might be too much, but who cared? It was just an experiment, anyway. Well, my mom might care. She&#x2019;s always concerned about being &#x201c;age appropriate.&#x201d;<br> <br>My mom called up from the kitchen that we had to go or I&#x2019;d be late, so I flipped off the bathroom light and took the stairs down, two at a time. As I swung around the banister and into the kitchen, my mom turned around and then did a double take.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Emma! Your hair looks gorgeous!&#x201d; she said with a gasp.<br> <br>I grinned. &#x201c;Thanks! You don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s too much?&#x201d;<br> <br>My mom laughed. &#x201c;Well, maybe for soccer practice or something, but under the circumstances, I think it will be a huge success!&#x201d; She smoothed her own perky blond ponytail and laughed again, looking down at her Nike sweatpants and Under Armor top. &#x201c;I am feeling very underdressed!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You look great, Mama,&#x201d; I said, calling her by my private baby name for her. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re the prettiest mom in school.&#x201d; I grabbed my jacket off the hook in my locker in the mudroom, stepped over about five piles of sweaty boys&#x2019; sporting goods, and headed out to the car.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, lovebug, you do say the sweetest things, even if they&#x2019;re not always true!&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>At The Special Day, Mona and her assistants were bustling around getting things set up for the day&#x2019;s trunk show.<br> <br>The Special Day is just what you would imagine if you were trying to picture the most awesome, over-the-top, bridal store. It&#x2019;s like a magical castle, and someday that&#x2019;s where I want to buy my wedding dress. First of all, outside the store they have beautiful green trees, and topiaries in white wooden flower boxes, and a pretty white awning with white lanterns hanging on either side of the door. It looks like something from movies I&#x2019;ve seen of Paris. Then, inside is white, white, white everywhere. A boy couldn&#x2019;t last one minute in there without ruining something, I tell you. There are thick white pile carpets, which make it really quiet; superplush white sofas and chairs that you sink into; low white marble coffee tables where tea is served in fine white china; and everywhere are white boxes of white Kleenex, because everyone cries when women try on wedding dresses. Once, I even saw Mona tear up when a young woman with cancer came in to try on her dress. She was bald from her treatment, but very brave and getting healthier, and Mona cried when she saw her in her beautiful dress.<br> <br>Today, Mona&#x2019;s main assistant, Patricia, came striding over to help me with my cupcake carriers. &#x201c;Oh, Emma! Your hair! You look incredible!&#x201d; said Patricia.<br> <br>I smiled. &#x201c;Thanks. It was just an experiment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, it looks wonderful. Mona! Come see Emma&#x2019;s new hairstyle!&#x201d;<br> <br>Mona looked up from the rack of dresses she was arranging, and I saw her tilt her head and squint at me. &#x201c;Emma!&#x201d; she cried. (Mona is really dramatic, by the way. Did I mention that?) She raced across the store toward me, her arms outstretched. &#x201c;Darling! You look divine! Simply divine!&#x201d; She had her hands on my arms, and now she pulled me in for a European-style two-cheek kiss. I laughed.<br> <br>Mona said, &#x201c;Oh, Patricia, isn&#x2019;t she divine?&#x201d;<br> <br>Smiling, Patricia nodded and added, &#x201c;Divine!&#x201d;<br> <br>(Did I mention that &#x201c;divine&#x201d; is Mona&#x2019;s favorite word?) But now Mona stopped gushing over me and patted her severe black bun. &#x201c;Patricia!&#x201d; she snapped, all business now. &#x201c;I have an idea!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, Mona? What is it?&#x201d; asked Patricia. Patricia is very patient, but I guess I don&#x2019;t need to mention that either.<br> <br>Mona circled me, looking at my new hair with her arms folded, tapping her chin, slightly bent at the waist. &#x201c;Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes!&#x201d; After what felt like an eternity, she looked up at Patricia with a gleam in her eye. &#x201c;Call Emma&#x2019;s mother and ask if we can photograph her today, and if so, could we use it in the paper. Then if she says yes, call Joachim and get him over here on the double. I&#x2019;d like to run another ad!&#x201d;<br> <br>I raised my eyebrows at Patricia and she raised hers back at me, and we smiled like coconspirators. An ad?! Holy smokes! Wait until I tell my friends, was all I could think! I prayed my mom said yes. Sometimes my parents can be funny about stuff like that&#x2014;they always are nice when people tell them I&#x2019;m pretty, like if we&#x2019;re out to dinner or something, but they always tell me after that looks don&#x2019;t last and that schoolwork and teamwork are more important than appearances. I know what they mean, but I still like it when people say I&#x2019;m pretty. Especially because I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m pretty all the time; only when I try a little and, like, wear something fancy or do my hair. Otherwise I think I just look normal.<br> <br>I went with Patricia to sort through the dresses I&#x2019;d wear today while she dialed my mom&#x2019;s cell on the cordless phone. Today&#x2019;s dresses were by Jaden Sacks, a famous designer from New York City. The line is superchic and exclusive. She usually only sells in her boutique on Madison Avenue. I know this because Mona told me the week before. She was very excited to be able to carry the dresses in the store. The junior bridesmaid dresses were gorgeous, made of incredible materials&#x2014;thick, slippery satin that pooled in my hand and slid through my fingers like quicksilver; pleated sheer silk so light and thin, it was like cotton candy on my skin; and lace that was somehow detailed and fancy on one side but cotton soft on the underside so it buffered me from the scratchiness of the stitching. The designs were simple&#x2014;fashion forward but not tacky or overdone. Jaden Sacks is famous for using the finest supplies and craftspeople. Mona also told me that, but I looked it up on the Internet, too. Her dresses for brides are not traditional puffy &#x201c;wedding cakes&#x201d; with lots of layers, but rather columns or sheaths or mermaids with trains. Very glamorous and understated. Her dresses for junior bridesmaids don&#x2019;t really look like bridesmaids dresses. They aren&#x2019;t too poufy or lacy or anything, and they don&#x2019;t look like mini brides, but they still look what my mom would call &#x201c;age appropriate.&#x201d; Which is good, because when it comes to modeling, my mom is all over being age appropriate. Mona has to show Mom all the dresses I&#x2019;ll wear beforehand, so she can okay them. It&#x2019;s kind of crazy. I mean, how can a bridesmaid dress be too sexy? But Mona says you&#x2019;d be surprised.<br> <br>Patricia whispered to me as she waited for my mom to pick up the phone, telling me that Mona was hoping Jaden Sacks might consider letting her carry the dresses for good, selling the line as a regular attraction at the store. Mona had already run a number of ads in the local paper about today&#x2019;s trunk show, and she was expecting a big crowd&#x2014;not just brides but local fashionistas who were curious to see the exclusive line on their home turf. (I already knew that one of my best friends, Mia, and her mom, Mrs. Valdes, who were major fashionistas and were clients of Mona&#x2019;s, were coming today to inspect the line and cheer on Mona. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to tell Mia about the potential ad!)<br> <br>I could hear Patricia speaking to my mom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Mrs. Taylor! Hi! It&#x2019;s Patricia at The Special Day! No, everything&#x2019;s fine. She&#x2019;s here. Everything is wonderful.&#x201d; There was a pause. &#x201c;No! The hair is divine! That&#x2019;s actually why I&#x2019;m calling you. Mona loved it so much that she had an idea to shoot photos of Emma today to run in an ad in the paper, and she wanted to know if that would be okay with you. We&#x2019;d pay her extra, of course.&#x201d; There was another pause. &#x201c;Yes, I totally understand. No, it&#x2019;s not a problem at all. Okay, talk soon. Bye!&#x201d; Patricia clicked the off button on the phone and set the receiver on the bench in the large fitting room. I waited for Patricia to give me the scoop. When she didn&#x2019;t immediately say anything, I had to ask.<br> <br>&#x201c;What did she say?!&#x201d; I couldn&#x2019;t contain my excitement any longer.<br> <br>&#x201c;She said it sounded like fun, but she wanted to talk it over with your father before she gave her permission.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What? That is such a bummer!&#x201d; I complained. I knew it was babyish, but I didn&#x2019;t care. How could my mom even think of saying no to an opportunity like this? My mom was protective, but oh boy, my dad was even more protective of me. There&#x2019;s no way he&#x2019;d say yes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, modeling is a big deal,&#x201d; Patricia reminded me gently. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re talking about putting your photo out there for all the world to see. It might seem like fun for you, but maybe your parents are worried it will give you an image that&#x2019;s not consistent with what they want for you. I completely respect your mother&#x2019;s response. Trust me&#x201d;&#x2014;Patricia rolled her eyes&#x2014;&#x201c;in the fashion business you get plenty of mothers who are just the opposite&#x2014;pushing their very young daughters at you, willing to sell their souls to the devil just to make some money off their child&#x2019;s looks before they change or get braces or whatever. It&#x2019;s a tough business.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;One ad doesn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m in the modeling business!&#x201d; I protested.<br> <br>Patricia smiled a wry smile. &#x201c;It might,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m calling Joachim, just in case, and telling him to stand by.&#x201d; She grabbed my hand and squeezed, then handed me my first dress and motioned that she was leaving.<br> <br>I beamed at Patricia and held up my crossed fingers as she left. Then I began to get ready. I hate changing in front of other people, so Mona got me a slip to wear under the dresses&#x2014;it&#x2019;s kind of like a long stretchy nude-colored camisole, and it makes me feel more comfortable, in case someone accidentally barges in. But Patricia always leaves me alone to get the slip on and get started, and she calls in to make sure I&#x2019;m ready before she comes back. We have a good routine now, and we totally get each other. It&#x2019;s kind of weird to think that one of my friends could be forty years older than me and working full-time in a bridal salon, but I&#x2019;d have to say that&#x2019;s the case with me and Patricia.<br> <br>The first Jaden Sacks dress was just so gorgeous. It had a high square neckline and what Patricia called &#x201c;tulip&#x201d; sleeves, which were capped kind of midway down my upper arm with overlapping petals of fabric. Then a high plain waist with a pale blue ribbon to define it, and a floor-length skirt of satin that swished heavily as I walked. The best part was it had a very light tulle underskirt in a pale blue that matched the ribbon and peeked out only when I moved. I loved it.<br> <br>I called Patricia, and she came back in, the phone pressed to her ear, nodding. Whoever she was talking to wouldn&#x2019;t let her get a word in edgewise. I hoped it wasn&#x2019;t my mom!<br> <br>I watched her face in the mirror as she bent her knees and clutched the receiver between her shoulder and chin so she could tie my ribbon with both hands. Then she leaned to the side to look at me in the mirror and gave me two thumbs-up and a wink. That meant I looked great. But who was on the phone?<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh. Yes. Yes. Okay. Right.&#x201d; Patricia was nodding again.<br> <br>I knitted my eyebrows together and mouthed, My mom? I was on pins and needles waiting to hear. But Patricia shook her head and covered the receiver with her hand. Joachim, she mouthed, and she rolled her eyes for the second time today. &#x201c;Right. Well, listen, Joachim, that&#x2019;s all great. I think your vision sounds wonderful, and we will have all the snacks on hand that you requested, as well as a space roped off for your shoot, and total privacy. Yes. I understand it will be a Sunday rate because it is so last-minute. I will confirm as soon as I hear back from the model. Thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Patricia sighed a deep sigh and sat down heavily on the bench. &#x201c;This is going to be a really long day,&#x201d; she said.</p><h2>New 800 Calorie HCG Diet</h2><p>&#x201c;Safer, healthier and just as easy and fast as the original 500 calorie HCG diet&#x201d; writes Richard Lipman M.D, board certified internist and endocrinologist in The New 800 Calorie HCG Diet. Many weight loss physicians agree that the original 500 calorie a day HCG diet is too limited in calories and choices for most patients. Over the past three years, Dr Lipman added additional low calorie and ultra low carb and fat foods, snacks and condiments to the diet of hundreds of HCG dieters. Not only did they feel less hungry and less deprived, but they lost the same weight as those following the original Simeons diet from 1954. Dr Lipman writes, &#x201c;almost all my patients noted more energy and less cravings with the larger portions and more choices in the new 800 calorie plan.&#x201d; In addition they lost the same weight without feeling deprived. Dr Lipman has explored hundreds of new meal combinations, added twenty new snacks including new five fruits, unlimited vegetables, soups, condiments and even ultra low carb wraps. Many of the products were originally for diabetics or for low carb dieters developed during the 2004 low carb craze. All of the choices are based principles originally described by Dr Simeons. This book describes the use of human hormone HCG or Human Chorionic Gonadotropin. This natural hormone reduces hunger and cravings and increases metabolic processes. This results in the same rapid weight loss observed in 500 calorie version. In fact, many of Dr Lipman&#x2019;s patients have experienced weight loss of between ï¿½ to 1 pounds per day on this plan. This book includes not only phase 1 and 2, but a completely re written phase 3. All of the HCG meal menus use thumbnail pictures showing choices, portions and preparations. No calorie counting is needed. The new 800 calorie HCG diet minimizes cooking and shopping for unusual foods. Everything than the dieter need is usually in the house or even and school or office cafeterias. This modernized HCG plan includes the new food protocol, all required HCG essentials, sample menus, new plateau breaking tips, modernized detailed guidelines for all three phases of the HCG plan.</p><p></p><h2>Imitation of Mary</h2><p><p>An excellent companion to <i>The Imitation of Christ</i>, this book is composed of writings about Our Lady carefully culled from the words of Thomas ï¿½ Kempis and set forth in the style of <i>The Imitation of Christ</i>.

Wallerstein sensitively illustrates how children of divorce often feel that their relationships are doomed, seek to avoid conflict, and fear commitment. Failure in their loving relationships often seems to them preordained, even when things are going smoothly. As Wallerstein checks in on the adults she first encountered as youngsters more than twenty-five years ago, she finds that their experiences mesh with those of the millions of other children of divorce, who will find themselves on every page.<br><br>With more than 100,000 copies in print, <em>The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce</em> spent three weeks on the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, and <em>Denver Post</em> bestseller lists. The book was also featured on two episodes of <em>Oprah</em> as well as on the front cover of <em>Time</em> and the <em>New York Times Book Review</em>.</p><p>During the last 40 years, our society's views on how families are created and how they operate has undergone a tremendous shift. In <i>The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce</i>, authors Judith Wallerstein, Julia Lewis, and Sandra Blakeslee have assembled a variety of stories from people of different ages and life stages. Some are children of divorce, some are from families that stayed unhappily intact, but all of them offer valuable information important to all of us as parents, children, and members of society at large. Separate chapters focus on the different roles children take on in the event of a divorce or unhappy marriage, ranging from positive role model to deeply troubled adolescent. In many cases, the people interviewed continue to define themselves as children of divorce up to 30 years after the occurrence; this is described by one subject as "sort of a permanent identity, like being adopted or something."<p> Both encouraging and thought-provoking, the final chapter questions how we maintain the freedom made possible by divorce while, at the same time, minimizing the damage. The authors' response to this question begins with pragmatic suggestions about strengthening marriage--not bland "family values" rhetoric but practical how-to ideas combined with national policy initiatives that have been making the rounds for years. With fascinating stories and statistics, Wasserstein, Lewis, and Blakeslee have illuminated the improvements within reach while our society experiences these massive changes in it's most fundamental relationships. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p><strong>Judith S.

Today, the Fed is the bedrock of the financial landscape, yet the fight to create it was so protracted and divisive that it seems a small miracle that it was ever established. <br><br>For nearly a century, America, alone among developed nations, refused to consider any central or organizing agency in its financial system. Americans&#x2019; mistrust of big government and of big banks&#x2014;a legacy of the country&#x2019;s Jeffersonian, small-government traditions&#x2014;was so widespread that modernizing reform was deemed impossible. Each bank was left to stand on its own, with no central reserve or lender of last resort. The real-world consequences of this chaotic and provincial system were frequent financial panics, bank runs, money shortages, and depressions. By the first decade of the twentieth century, it had become plain that the outmoded banking system was ill equipped to finance America&#x2019;s burgeoning industry. But political will for reform was lacking. It took an economic meltdown, a high-level tour of Europe, and&#x2014;improbably&#x2014;a conspiratorial effort by vilified captains of Wall Street to overcome popular resistance. Finally, in 1913, Congress conceived a federalist and quintessentially American solution to the conflict that had divided bankers, farmers, populists, and ordinary Americans, and enacted the landmark Federal Reserve Act.<br><br>Roger Lowenstein&#x2014;acclaimed financial journalist and bestselling author of <i>When Genius Failed</i> and <i>The End of Wall Street</i>&#x2014;tells the drama-laden story of how America created the Federal Reserve, thereby taking its first steps onto the world stage as a global financial power. <i>America&#x2019;s Bank</i> showcases Lowenstein at his very finest: illuminating complex financial and political issues with striking clarity, infusing the debates of our past with all the gripping immediacy of today, and painting unforgettable portraits of Gilded Age bankers, presidents, and politicians.<br><br>Lowenstein focuses on the four men at the heart of the struggle to create the Federal Reserve. These were Paul Warburg, a refined, German-born financier, recently relocated to New York, who was horrified by the primitive condition of America&#x2019;s finances; Rhode Island&#x2019;s Nelson W. Aldrich, the reigning power broker in the U.S. Senate and an archetypal Gilded Age legislator; Carter Glass, the ambitious, if then little-known, Virginia congressman who chaired the House Banking Committee at a crucial moment of political transition; and President Woodrow Wilson, the academician-turned-progressive-politician who forced Glass to reconcile his deep-seated differences with bankers and accept the principle (anathema to southern Democrats) of federal control. Weaving together a raucous era in American politics with a storied financial crisis and intrigue at the highest levels of Washington and Wall Street, Lowenstein brings the beginnings of one of the country&#x2019;s most crucial institutions to vivid and unforgettable life. Readers of this gripping historical narrative will wonder whether they&#x2019;re reading about one hundred years ago or the still-seething conflicts that mark our discussions of banking and politics today.&nbsp;</p><p>ROGER LOWENSTEIN reported for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> for more than a decade.

As the country put up factories and laid down rails, the tension between its antiquated finances and its smokestack-dotted towns grew ever more acute. Heated battles over &#x201c;the money question&#x201d; came to dominate the country&#x2019;s politics, but no matter how unsatisfied the people, any solution that tended toward centralization was, due to the&nbsp;prevailing prejudice, off the table.</p><p>America was a monetary Babel with thousands of currencies; each state regulated its own banks and they collectively provided the country&#x2019;s money. Officially, America was on a hard-money basis, but the amount of gold in circulation was insignificant. In any event, as a contemporary would write, it was impractical for a traveler &#x201c;to carry with him the coin necessary to meet his expenses for a protracted journey.&#x201d; If he traveled with notes of any but a few of the biggest banks in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, his money was likely to be refused, or greatly discounted. If he did carry gold, then, &#x201c;at the hotel, in the railroad car, on the river or lake,&#x201d; he would be ofï¿½fered slips of engraved paper that, in the words of a western banker, might include &#x201c;the frequently worthless issues of the State of Maine and of other New England States, the shinplasters of Michigan, the wild cats of Georgia, of Canada, and Pennsylvania, the red dogs of Indiana and Nebraska, the miserably engraved notes of North Caroï¿½lina, Kentucky, Missouri and Virginia, and the not-to-be-forgotten stump tails of Illinois and Wisconsin.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In theory, these notes were redeemable in gold or in state bonds, but notes from western banks were notoriously unreliable. Bankers, not surprisingly, sought to circulate their paper as far as possible from the point of issue. That way, the notes might never&#x2014;or not for a very long while&#x2014;return and the bank avoided the annoying detail of having to redeem its debts. There was no institution to regulate either the quality or the quantity of money, and after states adopted so-called free banking, a promoter needed little more than a printing press to set up shop. In 1853, Indiana&#x2019;s governor lamented, &#x201c;The specï¿½ulator comes to Indianapolis with a bundle of banknotes in one hand and the stock in the other; in twenty-four hours he is on his way to some distant point of the union to circulate what he denominates a legal currency, authorized by the legislature of Indiana.&#x201d; The system was certainly democratic&#x2014;almost anyone could issue &#x201c;money&#x201d;&#x2014;but it was just as certain to lead to credit booms and inevitable busts.</p><p>According to Jay Cooke, a Philadelphia financier, some banks issued notes equal to twenty-five times their capital &#x201c;with no other security than the good faith of their institution.&#x201d; Since such faith was often short-lived, Cooke hardly needed to add, &#x201c;confusion . . . was the order of the day.&#x201d; During the Civil War, the Chicago Tribune counted 1,395 banks in the Union states, each with bills of various denominations&#x2014;some 8,370 varieties of notes in all. Even for the careful bank teller, scrutinizing this profusion of paper became an almost hopeless task. In addition to bank failures, the country was plagued by con men whose note forgeries could be worthy of a Remï¿½brandt. So widespread were phony notes that &#x201c;Counterfeit Detectors&#x201d; were published, and these guides were widely circulated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This monetary chaos formed the tableau for late-nineteenthï¿½century reformers, and it is key to understanding how people of Glass&#x2019;s generation thought about money. Money&#x2014;generally, gold or silver&#x2014;was something of intrinsic value. Circulating paper, even though it served as a medium of exchange, was but a token, a promise of the real thing, discounted according to the degree to which people feared that the promise might not be kept.</p><p>Legislation during the Civil War provided a remedy&#x2014;somewhat. With the government desperate for credit, Lincoln&#x2019;s Treasury secreï¿½tary, Salmon P. Chase, was left no choice but to propose, and Conï¿½gress to approve, a new system of nationally chartered banks, which were permitted to issue circulating paper money in the form of National Bank Notes. These notes were to be a new, and mercifully uniform, currency, with a standard engraving on one side and the bank&#x2019;s name on the other. </p><p>However, note circulation was tightly controlled. National banks had to hold a reserve and submit to federal banking examinations. Also, to issue notes, they had to invest in a proportionate amount of government bonds and deposit them with the Treasury as collateral. This requirement heightened the demand for government securities&#x2014;which was, of course, Chase&#x2019;s purpose. By giving banks an incentive to invest in&nbsp;government debt, the United States contrived a means of financing the war. National banks were formed at a rapid clip, and many state banks converted to federal charters so they could qualify to circulate notes.[i] </p><p>The new notes were surely an improvement, but they had the drawback of arbitrariness. The quantity in circulation was determined by the level of investment in government bonds, and this bore no reï¿½lation to the needs of trade. Perversely, circulation often fell as busiï¿½ness activity expanded and banks found better outlets for their capital. Just as worrisome, the note supply was inelastic&#x2014;banks held the quantity of bonds that they held, and no new notes could be issued in a crisis. The modern notion of a central bank to supply extra liquidity when needed simply did not exist.</p><p>It is hard to overly blame Chase because, as he said, his goal was &#x201c;first to provide for the vast demands of the war.&#x201d; Chase was lauded for standardizing the currency and blunting the prior ability of banks to create inflation by circulating worthless paper. William G. Sumï¿½ner, an influential economist at Yale, fairly rejoiced: &#x201c;This system of currency has put an end at once and forever to the old bankers&#x2019; trick of expansion and contraction.&#x201d; That economies do expand&#x2014;and that currency needs to expand with them&#x2014;was largely overlooked.</p><p>Also overlooked, for the moment, was the precarious manner in which the National Banking Act marshaled the country&#x2019;s reserves. In Great Britain or in France, reserves were stored in the central bank. In America, the Banking Act introduced an intricate and fragile sysï¿½tem, with the reserves of one bank piled upon another.</p><p>The law recognized three distinct tiers of banks. The smallest, so-called country banks, had to either keep reserves in their vaults or deposit a portion with middle-tier banks in the city. The latter, in turn, could hold cash in the vault or deposit a portion of their reserves with banks in the highest tier, those in the &#x201c;central reserve cities&#x201d; of New York, Chicago, and St. Louis. In practice, since banks did not want to hold idle cash, reserves flowed to New York. And since the New York banks did not want idle money either, they lent their spare&nbsp;cash to the stock market. Thus, America&#x2019;s banking system was perched on a speculative pyramid. Whenever credit was in short supï¿½ply, the entire chain backed into reverse, with country banks calling their loans, by means of urgent telegrams, to banks in reserve cities and thence to New York. This could precipitate panicky selling in the stock market. As Glass was to write, the system was a &#x201c;breeder of panics,&#x201d; with the idle funds of the nation &#x201c;congested at the money centres for purely speculative purposes.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This defect quickly became apparent. In 1873, when the new era was not quite a decade old, Jay Cooke&#x2019;s firm, having improvidently speculated on railroad bonds, collapsed. The failure touched off a depression, which lasted six years. In a telltale sign of the system&#x2019;s defects, note circulation sharply declined. Even when business recovï¿½ered, the country was visited by periodic shortages of cash, or &#x201c;strinï¿½gencies,&#x201d; when interest rates would soar to as much as 100 percent. The problem was most acute in the fall, when farmers needed cash to&nbsp;move the crops. Farmhands had to be hired, horses fed, machinï¿½ery&nbsp;operated, shipping procured. The agrarian economy, as it were, sprung to life and required bundles of cash. This imbalanced the relative currency demands of city and farm, resulting in regular shortï¿½ages. No central reservoir existed to smooth out the seasonal&nbsp;lumpiï¿½ness. In short, the system suffered a serious deficit: it consistently failed to generate enough money.</p><p>One obvious solution was to supply more money, but that begged the question &#x201c;Who should supply it, and what kind of money?&#x201d; Though the new National Bank Notes served as walking-around money, the United States actually had seven different mediums of exchange circulating in varying amounts.[ii] During Glass&#x2019;s early life(the first few decades after the Civil War), Americans of every station fiercely debated how to bring order to this fiscal cacophony. In parï¿½ticular, they argued bitterly over whether gold should be supplemented by additional currency of some other type, including &#x201c;greenbacks,&#x201d; the colloquial name for the paper notes issued by the federal government during the Civil War. Because greenbacks were not supported by any metal or tangible asset, the banking class considered them abhorrent. They were mere paper, &#x201c;fiat&#x201d; money (exactly what circuï¿½lates today) and, to nineteenth-century bankers, an unpardonable blasphemy. In time, Congress decided to make greenbacks exchangeï¿½able for gold, and people who wanted to add to the currency shifted gears and proposed that the money supply be enhanced with notes that were backed by silver, which was more plentiful than gold. To supporters of the gold standard, silver, too, would merely cheapen the currency; it was both morally and economically repugnant.</p><p>Gold&#x2019;s champions tended to be creditors&#x2014;people with capital. They didn&#x2019;t want the currency debased because they didn&#x2019;t want to be&nbsp;repaid in cheaper coin. Gold being scarcer than silver, it was more valuable. In the 1870s, much of the world had joined Britain and gone on a gold standard (agreeing to back their currencies with gold). In1879, the United States did so as well. But Congress, trying to appease the farm lobby, directed the Treasury to also mint limited amounts of silver dollars, and at the historic ratio to gold of 16 to 1. Since the bulï¿½lion value of a silver &#x201c;dollar&#x201d; was, by then, appreciably less, owing to a divergence in the metals&#x2019; prices, bankers and Republicans regarded silver as a profane dilution. Grover Cleveland, a &#x201c;gold Democrat&#x201d; elected president in 1884 and again in 1892, spoke for Wall Street and for respectable opinion generally when he observed that if America went to a silver standard, &#x201c;we could no longer claim a place among nations of the first class.&#x201d; </p><p>As a practical matter, bankers were correct that the bimetallic sysï¿½tem of gold and silver was inherently unstable, since people would seek to cash in the poorer coin (in this case, the silver) for the richer one. But the gold standard imposed severe hardships on a great many Americans. In plain terms, the production of gold was not sufficient to support an adequate supply of money.</p><p>The issue was extremely divisive, because money shortages afï¿½fected Americans unevenly. American farmers, de Tocqueville noted, were less peasants than little businessmen. They took out loans for seed and equipment. When prices fell, their debts became crushing. Credit in farm communities was exceedingly scarce. The rigid rules of the Banking Act proscribed lending on real estate, which undercut the usefulness of national banks in rural areas. Cash was even scarcer. There were fewer bank notes issued in Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas, Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee combined than in the tiny Eastï¿½ern Seaboard state of Connecticut. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The hardship, and its palpable inequity, spawned a political awakening&#x2014;a cry for redress. People blamed the money scarcity on Wall Street or on its British equivalent, Lombard Street. Carter Glass was one of those. His sense of grievance was nourished by his diffiï¿½cult beginnings. Glass had been born in Lynchburg, Virginia, three years before the Civil War. His mother died when he was two, and his father, a publisher and a major in the Confederate ranks, suffered painful setbacks during the war, when he forfeited a vast quantity of cotton and had to sell his newspaper. After the war, he was offered the job of postmaster but refused to work for the federal government. Major Glass also had political ambitions, but these were frustrated by Reconstruction. For his son, it was a bitter inheritance, compounded by the sight of federal troops occupying Virginia. Carter, though, was a determined lad. Frail, with sallow skin and thin lips, often sickly with digestive problems and only five foot four, he was known as &#x201c;Pluck&#x201d; owing to his stubbornness and fiery temper. At age fourteen, he was forced to quit school but continued his studies at night, readï¿½ing his father&#x2019;s copies of Plato, Burke, and Shakespeare by kerosene lamp. Although Glass found work at a newspaper, his prospects were dimmed by the depression that ensued in 1873. Glass&#x2019;s view of this calamity was informed by his hostility to northern banks. For six straight years, as he tried to make his way in the world, the money stock shrank. Where did the money go? Gold had sucked it up&#x2014;so he believed. New York and London were in on it together. He reckï¿½oned that a malign conspiracy of financiers was to blame. Because he mistrusted power, he did not want more power. He did not want a central bank. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In 1880, Glass finally got the job he wanted&#x2014;newspaper reporter. Rising to publisher within a decade, Glass ceaselessly editorialized for silver. &#x201c;Why should gold be minted free [in unlimited amounts], any more than silver?&#x201d; he thundered in the Lynchburg News. Glass&#x2019;s crusade was as much emotional as deductive. &#x201c;I confess that with all I have read on both sides of the currency questions, I understand very little about it,&#x201d; he confided to a comrade. &#x201c;But when I see the merciï¿½less forces of corporate and individual wealth arrayed on one side, and the working, toiling masses on the other, I can but feel that you and I are right in the stand we have taken.&#x201d;</p><p>Silver-money advocates are often portrayed this way&#x2014;as emotional and ignorant. But their distress was real. Over the course of three decades&#x2014;beginning when Carter Glass was a boy&#x2014;prices in Amerï¿½ica steadily declined. No American born after the Great Depression has ever experienced even two consecutive years of deflation but, asï¿½tonishingly, from 1867 to 1897 prices skidded relentlessly lower, and over the whole of that period they tumbled well more than 50 percent. In 1867, when the future congressman was nine years old, a bushel of winter wheat fetched $2.84; thirty years later it was selling for a mere 90 cents. </p><p>Although the price of goods was falling, it is equally true, and more illuminating, to say that the price of money was rising.

But the aftermath of the attacks also revealed stories of heroism and sacrifice that inspired us all. They brought us an even deeper appreciation for, and commitment to, our country&#x2019;s founding freedoms. And they brought a powerful sense of unity not just to Americans, but also to people around the world. Out of the ashes of that clear September morning arose what the terrorists could never destroy: hope for a better future, faith in our common humanity, and pride in our country&#x2019;s freedoms and ideals.<br> &nbsp;<br> The universal impact of the terrorist attacks, and the ethnic and religious diversity of the victims, led people from around the world to offer their support, encouragement, and blessings to our city and country. Many joined Americans from all 50 states who selflessly stepped forward to assist in the unprecedented rescue and recovery. Together with everyone who supported a grieving neighbor, or donated to a charity, or displayed a ribbon or an Ameri- can flag, we sent a message to the terrorists: We may bend, but we will not break. We may stumble, but we will get back up. Our resilience was so strong because our defiance was so fierce.<br> &nbsp;<br> This resilience is the true legacy of 9/11. It defined the recovery effort itself, and it is at the heart of the mission of the National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum. This book chronicles the story of September 11 and the memorial, which is dedicated to the memory of all those killed in the terrorist attacks&#x2014;in New York City, at the Pentagon, near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The memorial will be forever a solemn place of reflection and remembrance; we owe that to all those who lost loved ones on 9/11. At the same time, the memorial will forever serve as a reminder of the enormous loss suffered that day, and the enormous sacrifices that were made&#x2014;and an obligation we owe to future generations.<br> &nbsp;<br> Family members played a crucial role in the planning and development of the memorial, and it could not have been built without the strong support they have given it. Nor could it have been built without the generous contributions made by people living in all 50 states and 38 countries. Their generosity grew out of the spirit of global unity that emerged in the aftermath of the attacks, and that helped America through some of its darkest hours.<br> &nbsp;<br> Since the attacks, millions of people from every corner of the globe have visited the World Trade Center site to pay their respects to those we lost. Now they arrive to experience a memorial as beautiful and inspiring as any that has ever been built, which is a testament not only to the creativity of Michael Arad&#x2019;s and Peter Walker&#x2019;s design, but also to the hard work of the memorial staff.<br> &nbsp;<br> The memories of all those we lost; the courage of all those who saved others; the solidarity that the world showed us; and the resilience that came to define the aftermath of the attacks&#x2014;all will live on in the memorial and museum, just as they live on in our hearts. And as long as they do, terrorism cannot and will not prevail in our society.<br> &nbsp;<br>&#x2014;MICHAEL R.

Everyone should have one, but not enough people do. If you're a boss, or hope to become one, or have a less-than-great boss, then this is the book that could change your career--and your life.<br><br>In times like these, being a great boss can be harder than ever. If you want surprising and useful advice on how to handle the tough stuff--from having to fire a long-time employee to being a new boss with a demoralized team--the stories, observations, and advice contained in this gem of a book will set your feet in the right direction. And if you just want advice on living up to the legend who preceded you in the job, or even ways to emulate someone who was a great boss to you, Jeffrey Fox has gathered anecdotes from some of the mightiest and most respected bosses in America. The bestselling author who brought you <em>How to Become CEO</em> and <em>How to Become a Rainmaker</em> knows the territory about which he speaks.<br><br>Fox is the master of the counterintuitive angle. For every boss who has implied "I know what's best, that's why I'm the boss," Fox counsels, "Listen to Phonies, Fools, and Frauds" and "Don't Check Expense Accounts." His stories from bosses who have cared equally for employees' lives and the bottom line will inspire you to see that profit counts, but so do camaraderie, motivation, and a great place to work.<br><br>In a time of considerable corporate downsizing, it's more important than ever for bosses to surround themselves with motivated employees.

The great boss makes people believe in themselves and feel special, selected, anointed. The great boss makes people feel good. </p><p>Great bosses are memorable. In sixty seconds, this boss created a memory to last over sixty years. </p><p>The employee was twenty-four. It was his first real job. He was in the fifth week. </p><p>That morning there was a knock on the six- foot-tall glass wall that framed his "office." "Excuse me, Mr. Godfrey, my name is Ralph Hart," said a courtly, exquisitely dressed man in his sixties. "Do you have a minute?" </p><p>"Of course," answered the young employee, who recognized the name, but not the face, of the company's legendary Chairman-of-the-Board. </p><p>"Thank you," said Mr. Hart. "Mr. Godfrey, may I tell you a few things about <i>your</i> company?" To the employee's nod, Mr. Hart continued: "Mr. Godfrey, your company is a first-class company. We have first-class products. We have first-class customers. We have first-class advertising. In fact, sometimes we even fly first-class because the airlines are some of our first-class customers." </p><p>Extending his hand to the new employee, Mr. Hart paused, and with eyes riveted on Godfrey, he concluded: "And Mr. Godfrey, we only hire first-class people. Welcome to Heublein." </p><p>If you believe that able and motivated people are the key to an enterprise's success, then Mr. Hart just taught you a lot. If you don't believe able and motivated people are the key to an enterprise's success, then stop reading and give this book to someone else. </p><p><b> II</b> </p><p><i>The Great Boss Simple Success Formula</i> </p><p>1. Only hire top-notch, excellent people. 2. Put the right people in the right job. Weed out the wrong people. 3. Tell the people what needs to be done. 4. Tell the people why it is needed. 5. Leave the job up to the people you've chosen to do it. 6. Train the people. 7. Listen to the people. 8. Remove frustration and barriers that fetter the people. 9. Inspect progress. 10. Say "Thank you" publicly and privately. </p><p><b>III</b> </p><p><i>Companies Do What the Boss Does</i> </p><p>People take their cues from the boss. The boss sets the tone and the standards. The boss sets the example. Over time, the department, the office, the store, the workshop, the factory, the company begin to do what the boss does. </p><p>If the boss is always late, punctuality becomes a minor obligation. If the boss is always in meetings, everybody is always in meetings. If the boss calls on customers, customers become important. If the boss blows off customer appointments, the salesforce makes fewer sales calls. If the boss is polite, rude people don't last. If the boss accepts mediocrity, mediocrity is what she gets. If the boss is innovative and inventive, the company looks for opportunities. If the boss does everyone's job, the employees will let him. If the boss gives everyone in the organization a World Series ring, then everyone wants to win the World Series. If the boss leads a charge, the good and able employees will be a step behind. </p><p>Great bosses understand this phenomenon. Great bosses position the organization to succeed, not with policies, but with posture and presence. If the great boss wants a policy of traveling on Sunday or practice before presentations, he or she travels on Sunday and practices presentations. If the boss doesn't want little snowstorms to make people late to the office, he gets in early the day of the storm and makes the coffee . . . and serves coffee to the stragglers as they arrive. </p><p>Some bosses lead purposefully, others innately. Whether intentional or not, the great boss shapes the organization. Because the company does what the boss does, the boss better perform, or the company won't. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2002 Jeffrey Fox</p></p><h2>Culturally Proficient Leadership: The Personal Journey Begins Within</h2><p><p>Becoming a culturally proficient leader requires the kind of courage, clarity, and insight that can only come from looking inward first.

Through the content in Chapters 1-4 and the accompanying reflective writing practices, our site leaders have begun to construct their own cultural autobiographies. Most effective have been the candid conversations principals have started having with each other about their own upbringing, as well as their noticings, wonderings, and increased self-awareness of their culture.

Pink, author of <i>Drive</i>).<br><br>The traditional attitude toward creativity in the American business world is to &#x201c;think outside the box&#x201d;&#x2014;to brainstorm without restraint in hopes of coming up with a breakthrough idea, often in moments of crisis. Sometimes it works, but it&#x2019;s a problem-specific solution that does nothing to engender creative thinking more generally. <i>Inside the Box</i> demonstrates Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT), which systemizes creativity as part of the corporate culture. This counterintuitive and powerfully effective approach to creativity requires thinking <i>inside</i> the box, working in one&#x2019;s familiar world to create new ideas independent of specific problems. SIT&#x2019;s techniques and principles have instilled creative thinking into such companies as Procter &amp; Gamble, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and other industry leaders.<i> Inside the Box </i>shows how corporations have successfully used SIT in business settings as diverse as medicine, technology, new product development, and food packaging.<br> <br>Dozens of books discuss how to make creative thinking part of a corporate culture, but none takes the innovative and unconventional approach of <i>Inside the Box. </i>With &#x201c;inside the box&#x201d; thinking, companies of any size can become sufficiently creative to solve problems even before they develop and to innovate on an ongoing basis. It&#x2019;s a system that works!<br> <br>&#x201c;Boyd and Goldenberg explain the basic building blocks for creativity and by doing so help all of us better express our potential&#x201d; (Dan Ariely, author of <i>Predictably Irrational</i>).</p><p>Drew Boyd<b> </b>is assistant professor of marketing and innovation at the University of Cincinnati. He trains and consults in the fields of innovation, marketing, persuasion, and social media. He lives in Cincinnati, Ohio.<br><br>Jacob Goldenberg<b> </b>is a marketing professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. He studies creativity, new product development, innovation, market dynamics, and the effects of social networks. He lives in Jerusalem, Israel.Inside the Box INTRODUCTION<p></p> <br>&#x201c;It worked!&#x201d; I told Jacob Goldenberg, my friend and coauthor of this book. &#x201c;They used the method, and used it well.&#x201d; Although it was late for us to be on Skype given the seven-hour time difference between Cincinnati and Jerusalem, Jacob was eager to hear how my latest class had gone. Jacob and his colleagues in Israel, Roni Horowitz and Amnon Levav, had developed a new method of creativity and had been teaching it to corporate executives, engineers, marketing professionals, and other business leaders all over the world. Still, this latest class of mine was a true test of whether the method was fail-proof and reliable as we all believed.<br> <br>Yes it was, I was happy to report. One of the students in particular had achieved the kind of creative breakthrough Jacob and I had hoped for&#x2014;and which we&#x2019;d seen happen time and time again with seasoned professionals. I had handed sixteen-year-old Ryan an ordinary flashlight and, after walking him through the required steps of the method, instructed him to invent something new. Ryan&#x2019;s invention was a simple modification of the flashlight&#x2019;s on-off switch. He created a switch that would also act as a dimmer, changing the brightness of the light as needed. This may not seem to be a particularly exciting idea to you, and it&#x2019;s not the most revolutionary idea we&#x2019;ll introduce in this book. But listen to the circumstances.<br> <br>Ryan was part of a group of special-needs students at the Hughes Center High School in Cincinnati. These students had various cognitive and motor limitations, including autism and learning disorders. Ryan has Down syndrome. Despite his cognitive limitations, he was able to learn and successfully use the same method that you will learn here, a method in use by leading corporations and inventors around the world.<br> A METHOD TO INNOVATE<p></p> <br>The traditional view of creativity is that it is unstructured and doesn&#x2019;t follow rules or patterns. That you need to think &#x201c;outside the box&#x201d; to be truly original and innovative. That you should start with a problem and then &#x201c;brainstorm&#x201d; ideas without restraint until you find a solution. That you should &#x201c;go wild&#x201d; making analogies to things that have nothing to do with your products, services, or processes. That straying as far afield as possible will help you come up with a breakthrough idea.<br> <br>We believe just the opposite. We&#x2019;ll show you that more innovation&#x2014;and better and quicker innovation&#x2014;happens when you work inside your familiar world (yes, inside the box) using what we call templates. We don&#x2019;t make that claim lightly. Jacob, Roni, Amnon, and their advisors, professors David Mazursky and Sorin Solomon, developed this method of creativity inspired by the work of pioneering researcher Genrich Altshuller. Altshuller discovered that creative solutions have an underlying logic that can be defined and taught to others. His focus on patterns in engineering solutions stimulated Jacob and his partners to ask the same questions about patterns in highly innovative products and services.<br> <br>By 1999, this team had studied hundreds of successful products to see what made them different from similar products. What they found will surprise you. You&#x2019;d think that new and innovative products would be quite different from each other. In fact, inventive solutions share certain patterns, patterns that can be formed into templates. These templates regulate our thinking and channel the creative process in a way that makes us more&#x2014;not less&#x2014;creative.<br> <br>We believe innovators from all corners of the world have used templates in their inventions for thousands of years, most of them without realizing it. Those templates are now encoded like DNA into the products and services you see around you.<br> <br>Surprisingly, the majority of new, inventive, and successful products result from only five templates: subtraction, division, multiplication, task unification, and attribute dependency. These templates form the basis of the innovation method called Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT). In the twenty years since its inception, the method has been expanded to cover a wide range of innovation-related phenomena in a variety of contexts. By using Systematic Inventive Thinking, companies have produced breakthrough results in many types of situations and in every part of the world. In this book we focus on the basic techniques and principles that are at the method&#x2019;s core and that make it unique.<br> <br>You may have been struck by the word systematic in Systematic Inventive Thinking. Most people are. We know it sounds counterintuitive, the notion that creativity can be systematic. Yet it can be. The method also happens to be very effective at making creativity accessible to anyone. And by using the method, you will be consciously harnessing templates mankind has used intuitively for ages to create new ideas.<br> <br>Does it work? Royal Philips Electronics, a world-leading electronics firm, used the &#x201c;Subtraction&#x201d; technique to revolutionize the DVD market. Remember when DVD players looked like the traditional bulky VCR players, with a confusing number of buttons and displays on the front panel? The Philips team used our approach to develop a DVD player controlled by a handheld device. The result: a slimmer, cheaper, easier-looking, and easier-to-use DVD machine. Philips&#x2019;s solution redefined the DVD market and established a new design standard for today&#x2019;s DVD players and other home electronics. That was just one of 149 usable ideas Philips generated using SIT on that occasion.<br> <br>Samsonite, the world&#x2019;s largest travel bag company, used the &#x201c;Task Unification&#x201d; technique to expand into the college backpack market. Backpacks, especially for college students, cause back and neck strain due to the weight of their contents: textbooks, laptop, and so on. Instead of padding the straps like all others, the Samsonite team created a way to use the heavy weight as a comfort advantage. The straps are shaped so that they press softly into the wearer&#x2019;s shoulders at strategically located &#x201c;shiatsu points&#x201d; to provide a soothing massage sensation. The heavier the contents, the deeper the sensation and the more stress-relieving for the wearer.<br> <br>Pearson Education, the world&#x2019;s leading education company, used the &#x201c;Multiplication&#x201d; technique to create a new course designed specifically for students who failed pre-algebra or algebra and needed a different approach to studying these subjects. By the way, it&#x2019;s just a coincidence that the multiplication technique was helpful with the math curriculum; that same technique also led Pearson to invent a new audio planning coach that helps teachers plan their lessons and to create a new web-based approach to customer service.<br> <br>In this book, we&#x2019;re going to teach you how to apply our inside-the-box approach to develop any type of product, service, or process. We&#x2019;ll illustrate each technique with lots of examples, both from clients we&#x2019;ve worked with and from the world at large.<br> <br>Consider, for example, Bill Frisell, one of the leading jazz guitarists since the late 1980s. He is known for using an array of electronic effects (delay, distortion, reverb, octave shifters, and volume pedals, to name a few) to create unique sounds from his instrument. One of Frisell&#x2019;s favorite techniques to devise new sounds is to imagine having only one of the guitar&#x2019;s six strings available to him. He subtracts the others by restricting himself to playing on one string and forcing himself to make more creative music. Bill Frisell became more creative when he worked inside the box&#x2014;that is, confined to a guitar but with some key elements subtracted.<br> <br>In situation after situation, the same five templates keep showing up as keys to innovation. The more you learn about this approach, the more you will start to see the five techniques being applied to solve tough problems and create all sorts of breakthroughs.<br> <br>The five techniques are:<br> <br>SUBTRACTION. Innovative products and services often have had something removed, usually something that was previously thought to be essential to the product or service. Discount airlines subtracted the frills. Removing the ear covers from traditional headphones gave us &#x201c;ear buds&#x201d; placed inside one&#x2019;s ear. Subtracting the polymer from permanent markers created the dry-erase marker. Defying all logic, Apple took out the calling feature of its popular iPhone to create the iTouch and has sold sixty million iTouches since.<br> <br>DIVISION. Many creative products and services have had a component divided out of them and placed somewhere else in the usage situation, usually in a way that initially seemed unproductive or unworkable. Products in your home that use remote controls deliver more convenience thanks to the &#x201c;Division&#x201d; pattern. Exercise dumbbells allow you to regulate the right amount of weight to build muscle mass. Computer printers allow you to separate the ink cartridge for easy replacement.<br> <br>MULTIPLICATION. With this technique, a component has been copied but changed in some way, usually in a way that initially seemed unnecessary or odd. For instance, children&#x2019;s bicycles have regular wheels plus two smaller &#x201c;training wheels&#x201d; attached to the rear wheel to keep the bicycle steady while the child learns how to ride. &#x201c;Picture-in-picture&#x201d; TVs were a big hit with consumers because they allowed people to watch one show while keeping track of what was happening on another channel, such as a major sporting event or news story.<br> <br>TASK UNIFICATION. With some creative products and services, certain tasks have been brought together and unified within one component of the product or service&#x2014;usually a component that was previously thought to be unrelated to that task. Odor-Eaters socks keep you warm and have the additional job of deodorizing. Facial moisturizers now have the additional task of providing sunscreen protection. Advertisers have used this technique for years, placing ads on moving objects such as taxis, metro buses, and even school buses.<br> <br>ATTRIBUTE DEPENDENCY. In many innovative products and services, two or more attributes that previously seemed unrelated now correlate with one another. As one thing changes, something else changes. Today&#x2019;s automobiles use this pattern a lot: windshield wipers that change speed as the amount of rain changes, radio volume that adjusts according to the speed of the car, and headlights that dim automatically for oncoming cars, to name a few. Smartphones provide information about restaurants, locations of nearby friends, and shopping preferences depending on your current location. The information is dependent on geolocation. It is hard to imagine life without these innovations, all created with this common technique.<br> WHY TEMPLATES MATTER<p></p> <br>But wait. Doesn&#x2019;t this go against everything you&#x2019;ve learned about creativity? Could creativity be as simple as following templates?<br> <br>In 1914 psychologist Wolfgang Kï¿½hler embarked on a series of studies about chimpanzees and their ability to solve problems. He documented the research in his book The Mentality of Apes. In one experiment, he took a newborn chimp and placed her in an isolated cage, before she saw or made contact with other chimps. He named her Nueva.<br> <br>Three days later, researchers placed a small stick in the cage. Curious, Nueva picked up the stick, scraped the ground, and played with it briefly. She lost interest and dropped the stick.<br> <br>Ten minutes later, a bowl of fruit was placed outside her cage, just out of Nueva&#x2019;s reach. She reached out between the bars of the cage as far as she could, but to no avail. She tried and tried, whimpering and uttering cries of despair. Finally, she gave up and threw herself on her back, frustrated and despondent.<br> <br>Seven minutes later, Nueva suddenly stopped moaning. She sat up and looked at the stick. She then grabbed it and, extending her arm outside the cage, placed the end of the stick directly behind the bowl of fruit. She drew in the bowl just close enough to reach the fruit with her hand. Kï¿½hler described her behavior as &#x201c;unwaveringly purposeful.&#x201d;<br> <br>Kï¿½hler repeated the test an hour later. On the second trial, Nueva went through the same cycle as before&#x2014;displaying eagerness to reach the fruit, frustration when she couldn&#x2019;t, and despair that caused her to give up temporarily&#x2014;but took much less time to use the stick. On all subsequent tests, she didn&#x2019;t get frustrated and didn&#x2019;t hesitate. She just waited eagerly with her little innovation in hand.<br> <br>Three-day-old Nueva created a tool using a time-honored creativity template, one of many used by primates&#x2014;including man&#x2014;for thousands of years. That template: use objects close by to solve problems. Once she saw the value in this approach, Nueva began using it over and over again.<br> <br>Patterns play a vital role in our everyday lives. We call them habits, and, as the saying goes, we are indeed creatures of them. Habits simplify our lives by triggering familiar thoughts and actions in response to familiar information and situations. This is the way our brains process the world: by organizing it into recognizable patterns. These habits or patterns get us through the day&#x2014;getting up, showering, eating breakfast, going to work. Because of them, we don&#x2019;t have to spend as much effort the next time we encounter that same information or find ourselves in a similar situation.<br> <br>Mostly, without even thinking about them, we apply patterns to our everyday conventions and routines. But certain patterns lead to unconventional and surprising outcomes. We especially remember those patterns that help us solve problems. Patterns that help us do something different are valuable. We don&#x2019;t want to forget those, so we identify them and &#x201c;codify&#x201d; them into repeatable patterns called templates. You could say that a template is a pattern consciously used over and over to achieve results that are as new and unconventional as those you obtained the first time you used it.<br> <br>Even chimpanzees like baby Nueva can follow templates once they see the value. She used the stick to retrieve the fruit. Her template became &#x201c;Use objects close by for new tasks.&#x201d; In fact, apes are quite good at this particular template; as Nueva did intuitively, they constantly use objects in their environment for unconventional ends. For example, they place sticks inside anthills so that ants crawl onto the stick for easy eating. Dr. Kï¿½hler&#x2019;s research showed that apes not only find indirect, novel solutions but also overcome their habitual tendency to use direct approaches. They &#x201c;repattern&#x201d; their thinking. They generalize the pattern so that it becomes usable in a variety of scenarios.<br> <br>But don&#x2019;t get the idea that the goal of templates is to simply make everything rote and routine. The most highly creative humans use templates to produce extraordinary results. Once they discover a pattern that is successful, they stick with it. Consider one of the most successful musicians in history, Paul McCartney, and his songwriting partner in the Beatles, John Lennon. In one of his biographies, Paul confided how he and John wrote music early in their careers: &#x201c;As usual, for these cowritten things, John often had just the first verse, which was always enough: it was the direction, it was the signpost, and it was the inspiration for the whole song. I hate the word, but it was the template.&#x201d;<br> <br>Paul and John did the same as Nueva did with her stick. They discovered successful patterns in music and created a sophisticated set of reusable music-making templates that allowed them to generate one hit song after another. Guinness World Records calls McCartney the &#x201c;most successful composer and recording artist of all time.&#x201d; He has reco...</p><h2>One Half from the East</h2><p><p><strong>Perfect for fans of Rita Williams-Garcia, Thanhha Lai, and Rebecca Stead, internationally bestselling author Nadia Hashimi&#x2019;s first novel for young readers is a coming-of-age journey set in modern-day Afghanistan that explores life as a </strong><em><strong>bacha posh</strong></em><strong>&#x2014;a preteen girl dressed as a boy.</strong></p><p>Obayda&#x2019;s family is in need of some good fortune, and her aunt has an idea to bring the family luck&#x2014;dress Obayda, the youngest of four sisters, as a boy, a <em>bacha posh</em>.</p><p>Life in this in-between place is confusing, but once Obayda meets another <em>bacha posh</em>, everything changes.

The titles of his previous works are indicative of his approach: catchy, contemporary, in touch with Lewis Carroll and &#34;Sesame Street&#34; as well as modern counseling modes, yet grounded in narratives from the Old and New Testaments. His principal interest is spiritual formation, which is in some ways an ideal match for Americans today. It is less concerned with dogmatics than with the development of the self. Ortberg is adept in using his pastoral experience and knowledge of scripture to develop his argument, which stresses faith in God&#39;s invitations to Christians to move forward, into the unknown.

Which was fairly often.<br> <br>Her name was Feodora.<br> <br>She lived in a wooden house made of timber taken from the surrounding forest. The walls were layered with sheep&#x2019;s wool to keep out the Russian winter, the windows were double thick, and the inside was lit with hurricane lamps. Feo had painted the lamps every color in her box of paints, so the house cast out light into the forest in reds and greens and yellows. Her mother had cut and sanded the door herself, and the wood was eight inches thick. Feo had painted it snow blue. The wolves had added claw marks over the years, which helped dissuade unwelcome visitors.<br> <br>It all began&#x2014;all of it&#x2014;with someone knocking on the snow-blue door.<br> <br>Although &#x201c;knocking&#x201d; was not the right word for this particular noise, Feo thought. It sounded as though someone was trying to dig a hole in the wood with his knuckles. But any knocking at all was unusual. Nobody knocked: It was just her and her mother and the wolves. Wolves do not knock. If they want to come in, they come in through the window, whether it is open or not.<br> <br>Feo put down the skis she was oiling and listened. It was early, and she was still wearing her nightdress. She had no dressing gown, but she pulled on the sweater her mother had knit, which came down to the scar on her knee, and ran to the front door.<br> <br>Her mother was wrapped in a bearskin housecoat, just looking up from the fire she had been lighting in the sitting room.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it!&#x201d; Feo tugged at the door with both hands. It was stiff; ice had sealed the hinges.<br> <br>Her mother grabbed at her&#x2014;&#x201c;Wait! Feo!&#x201d;<br> <br>But Feo already had pulled the door open, and before she could jump back, it slapped inward, catching the side of her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ach!&#x201d; Feo stumbled, and sat down on her own ankle. She said a word that made the stranger pushing his way past her raise his eyebrows and curl his lip.<br> <br>The man had a face made of right angles: a jutting nose and wrinkles in angry places, deep enough to cast shadows in the dark.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is Marina Petrovna?&#x201d; His boots left a trail of snow down the hall.<br> <br>Feo got to her knees&#x2014;and then lurched back, as two more men in gray coats and black boots marched past her, missing her fingers by inches. &#x201c;Move, girl.&#x201d; They carried between them, slung by its legs, the body of a young elk. It was dead, and dripping blood.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; said Feo. Both wore the tall furry hats of the tsar&#x2019;s Imperial Army, and exaggeratedly official expressions.<br> <br>Feo ran after them. She readied her elbows and knees to fight.<br> <br>The two soldiers dropped the elk on the rug. The sitting room was small, and the two young men were large and mustached. Their mustaches seemed to take up most of the room.<br> <br>Up close, they looked barely more than sixteen; but the man with the door-beating fists was old, and his eyes were the oldest thing about him. Feo&#x2019;s stomach bunched up under her throat.<br> <br>The man spoke over Feo&#x2019;s head to her mother. &#x201c;Marina Petrovna? I am General Rakov.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; Marina&#x2019;s back was against the wall.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am commander of the tsar&#x2019;s Imperial Army for the thousand miles south of Saint Petersburg. And I am here because your wolves did this,&#x201d; he said. He kicked at the elk. Blood spread across his brightly polished shoe.<br> <br>&#x201c;My wolves?&#x201d; Her mother&#x2019;s face was steady, but her eyes were neither calm nor happy. &#x201c;I do not own any wolves.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You bring them here,&#x201d; said Rakov. His eyes had a coldness in them you do not expect to see in a living thing. &#x201c;That makes them your responsibility.&#x201d; His tongue was stained yellow by tobacco.<br> <br>&#x201c;No. No, neither of those things is true,&#x201d; said Feo&#x2019;s mother. &#x201c;Other people send the wolves when they tire of them: the aristocrats, the rich. We untame them, that&#x2019;s all. And wolves cannot be owned.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lying will not help you, madam.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am not&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Those three wolves I see your child with. Those are not yours?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, of course not!&#x201d; began Feo. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re&#x2014;&#x201d; But her mother shook her head, hard, and gestured to Feo to stay silent. Feo bit down on her hair instead, and tucked her fists into her armpits to be ready.<br> <br>Her mother said, &#x201c;They are hers only in the sense that I am hers and she is mine. They are Feo&#x2019;s companions, not her pets. But that bite isn&#x2019;t the work of Black or White or Gray.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. The jaw marks,&#x201d; said Feo. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re from a much smaller wolf.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are mistaken,&#x201d; said Rakov, &#x201c;in imagining I wish to hear excuses.&#x201d; His voice was growing less official: louder, ragged edged.<br> <br>Feo tried to steady her breathing. The two young men, she saw, were staring at her mother: One of them had let his jaw sag open. Marina&#x2019;s shoulders and back and hips were wide; she had muscles that were more commonly seen on men, or rather, Feo thought, on wolves. But her face, a visitor had once said, was built on the blueprint used for snow leopards, and for saints. &#x201c;The look,&#x201d; he had said, &#x201c;is &#x2018;goddess, modified.&#x2019;?&#x201d; Feo had pretended, at the time, not to be proud.<br> <br>Rakov seemed immune to her mother&#x2019;s beauty. &#x201c;I have been sent to collect compensation for the tsar, and I shall do that, immediately. Do not play games with me. You owe the tsar a hundred rubles.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a hundred rubles.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rakov slammed his fist against the wall. He was surprisingly strong for so old and shriveled a man, and the wooden walls shuddered. &#x201c;Woman! I have no interest in protests or excuses. I have been sent to wrest obedience and order from this godforsaken place.&#x201d; He glanced down at his red-speckled shoe. &#x201c;The tsar rewards success.&#x201d; Without warning, he kicked the elk so hard that its legs flailed, and Feo let out a hiss of horror.<br> <br>&#x201c;You!&#x201d; The General crossed to her, leaning down until his face, veined and papery, was inches from hers. &#x201c;If I had a child with a stare as insolent as yours, she would be beaten. Sit there and keep out of my sight.&#x201d; He pushed her backward, and the cross hanging from his neck caught in Feo&#x2019;s hair. He tugged it away viciously and passed through the door back into the hall. The soldiers followed him. Marina signaled to Feo to stay&#x2014;the same hand gesture they used for wolves&#x2014;and ran after them.<br> <br>Feo crouched down in the doorway, waiting for the buzzing in her ears to die away; then she heard a cry and something breaking, and ran, skidding down the hall in her socks.<br> <br>Her mother was not there, but the soldiers had crowded into Feo&#x2019;s bedroom, filling her room with their smell. Feo flinched away from it: It was smoke, she thought, and a year&#x2019;s worth of sweat and unwashed facial hair. One of the soldiers had an underbite he could have picked his own nose with.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing worth anything,&#x201d; said one soldier. His eyes moved across her reindeer-skin bedspread and the hurricane lamp and came to rest on her skis, leaning against the fireplace. Feo ran to stand protectively in front of them.<br> <br>&#x201c;These are mine!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re nothing to do with the tsar. I made them.&#x201d; It had taken her a whole month to make each ski, whittling them every evening and smoothing them with grease. Feo gripped one in both fists like a spear. She hoped the prickling in her eyes was not visible. &#x201c;Get away from me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rakov smiled, not sweetly. He took hold of Feo&#x2019;s lamp, held it up to the morning light. Feo grabbed at it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d; said Marina. She stood in the doorway. There was a bruise on her cheek that had not been there before. &#x201c;Can&#x2019;t you see this is my daughter&#x2019;s room?&#x201d;<br> <br>The young men laughed. Rakov did not join in: He only stared at them until they turned red and fell silent. He crossed to Feo&#x2019;s mother, studied the mark on her cheek. He leaned forward until the tip of his nose was touching her skin, and sniffed. Marina stood motionless, her lips bitten shut. Then Rakov grunted and threw the lamp at the ceiling.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chyort!&#x201d; cried Feo, and ducked. Broken glass rained down on her shoulders. She lunged forward at the general, swinging blindly with her ski. &#x201c;Get out!&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Get out!&#x201d;<br> <br>The general laughed, caught the ski, and wrenched it from her. &#x201c;Sit down and behave, before you make me angry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get out,&#x201d; said Feo.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sit! Or you will end up in the same position as that elk.&#x201d;<br> <br>Marina seemed to jerk into life. &#x201c;What? What insanity in your head makes you think you can threaten my child?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You both disgust me.&#x201d; Rakov shook his head. &#x201c;It is an abomination to live with those animals. Wolves are vermin with teeth.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That is . . .&#x201d; Feo&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s face spoke a hundred different swearwords before she said, &#x201c;Inaccurate.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And your daughter is vermin when she is with those wolves. I&#x2019;ve heard stories about you both&#x2014;you&#x2019;re unfit to be a mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>Marina let out a sound that it hurt Feo to hear, partway between a gasp and a hiss.<br> <br>He went on. &#x201c;There are schools&#x2014;in Vladivostok&#x2014;where she could learn the values of a better mother&#x2014;Mother Russia. Perhaps I will have her sent there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Feo,&#x201d; said Marina, &#x201c;go and wait in the kitchen. Immediately, please.&#x201d; Feo darted out, rounded the door and stopped there, hesitating, peering through the crack in the hinge. Her mother&#x2019;s face, as she turned to Rakov, was shining with anger and with other, more complicated things.<br> <br>&#x201c;Feo is my child. For God&#x2019;s sake, do you not know what that means?&#x201d; Marina shook her head incredulously. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s worth an entire army of men like you, and my love for her is a thing you should underestimate only if you have a particularly powerful death wish. The love of a parent for a child&#x2014;it burns.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How inconvenient for you!&#x201d; Rakov ran a hand along his chin. &#x201c;What is your point?&#x201d; He wiped his boot on the bed. &#x201c;And make it quick, you&#x2019;re becoming tedious.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My point is that you will keep your hands off my daughter if you value their current position at the ends of your arms.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rakov snorted. &#x201c;That is somewhat unfeminine.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all. It seems profoundly feminine to me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Rakov stared at Marina&#x2019;s fingers, the tips of two of which were missing, and then at her face. His expression was frightening: There was something uncontained about it. Marina stared back at him. Rakov blinked first.<br> <br>He grunted, and strode out the door. Feo twisted backward out of his way, then ran after him into the kitchen.<br> <br>&#x201c;You are not making this easy for yourself,&#x201d; he said. His face was dispassionate as he gripped the side of the dining table and overturned it. Feo&#x2019;s favorite mug crashed on the floor.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mama!&#x201d; said Feo. She took a handful of her mother&#x2019;s coat as Marina swept into the room, and held it tight.<br> <br>Rakov did not even glance in her direction. &#x201c;Take the paintings,&#x201d; he said. They had three, each with boldly colored cubes arranged in shapes that hinted at men and women. Marina loved them. Feo humored her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait, don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; said Feo. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Mama&#x2019;s Malevich. It was a present! Wait! Here. There&#x2019;s this!&#x201d; Feo fished her gold chain from around her neck and held it out to the youngest soldier. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s gold. It was Mama&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s before it was mine, so it&#x2019;s old. Gold&#x2019;s worth more when it&#x2019;s old.&#x201d; The soldier bit the chain, sniffed it, nodded, and handed it to Rakov.<br> <br>Feo ran to open the front door. She stood by it, the snow blowing in and coating her socks. Her whole body was shaking. &#x201c;Now you have to go.&#x201d;<br> <br>Marina closed her eyes for one brief moment, then opened them and smiled at Feo. The two soldiers spat on the floor in a bored kind of way and headed out into the snow.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is the only warning you will be given,&#x201d; said Rakov. He ignored the open door and the snow-covered wind. &#x201c;The tsar&#x2019;s orders. The tsar will not have his animals slaughtered by wolves you have taught to hunt. From now on, if the people of the city send you wolves, you shoot them.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; said Feo. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t! Anyway, we don&#x2019;t have a gun! Tell him, Mama!&#x201d;<br> <br>Rakov ignored her. &#x201c;You will send back a message to the superstitious idiots who send their ridiculous pets to you that you have released them into the wild, and then you will shoot the animals.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I will not,&#x201d; said Marina. Her face looked empty of blood. It made Feo&#x2019;s stomach ache; it made her wish that she had a gun to point at the man in the doorway.<br> <br>Rakov&#x2019;s coat wrinkled as he shrugged. &#x201c;You know the penalty for those who act against the orders of the tsar? You remember what happened to the rioters in Saint Petersburg? This is the only warning you will receive.&#x201d; He crossed to the front door, and as he passed he pointed a gloved finger at Feo&#x2019;s heart. &#x201c;You too, girl.&#x201d; He jabbed once, hard, against her collarbone. Feo jumped backward.<br> <br>&#x201c;If we see that child with a wolf, we&#x2019;ll shoot the wolf and take the child.&#x201d;<br> <br>He slammed the door behind him.<br> <br><br> <br>Later that day Feo and her mother sat by the fire. The shards of broken glass and china had been swept clear and the elk had been packed in ice and stored in the woodshed&#x2014;Feo had wanted to bury it properly, with a cross and a funeral, but her mother had said no: They might need to eat it if the winter kept marching on. Feo rested her head on her mother&#x2019;s shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;What do we do now, Mama?&#x201d; she asked. &#x201c;Now they&#x2019;ve said we have to kill the wolves? We won&#x2019;t, will we? I won&#x2019;t let you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, lapushka!&#x201d; Marina&#x2019;s arm, with its embroidery of scars and muscle, enwrapped Feo. &#x201c;Of course not. But we&#x2019;ll be a little more silent, and a little more watchful.&#x201d; She rattled the chestnuts roasting in the grate, and flipped one into Feo&#x2019;s hands. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s what the wolves do. We can do it too. Can&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course they could, Feo thought that evening as she put on her skis. Humans, on the whole, Feo could take or leave; there was only one person she loved properly, with the sort of fierce pride that gets people into trouble, or prison, or history books. Her mother, she thought, could do anything.<br> <br>It took Feo ten minutes to ski to the ruins of the stone chapel. At the entrance hall were three dilapidated statues of saints: They had no heads, and two of them had grown a scaly skin of green lichen. Even without heads, the saints managed to look unimpressed by this state of affairs. Only two and a half of the chapel walls were still standing, and the roof had long ago crumbled onto the mosaic floor below. There were pews, half eaten away by woodworm, and a marble miniature of the Virgin, which Feo had cleaned with the chewed end of a twig. If the light was right in the chapel, and if you looked closely, you could see that the walls had once been painted with gold figures. It was, Feo thought, the most beautiful place on earth.<br> <br>In the chapel lived a pack of three wolves.<br> <br>One wolf was white, one black, and one a grayish mix, with black ears and the face of a politician. They could not be called tame&#x2014;they certainly would not come if you called&#x2014;but nor were they wholly wild. And Feo, the neighbors said, was half feral herself, and they looked in horror at her wolf-smelling red cloak. It made sense, then, that Feo and the wolves would be best friends: They met each other halfway.<br> <br>As she skied in through the door, the wolves were chewing on the carcasses of two ravens, covering the statue of Mary with flecks of blood. Feo did not go close&#x2014;it is wisest not to interrupt wolves when they are eating, even if they are your...</p><h2>The Leprechaun&#39;s Gold</h2><p><p><strong>Based on a classic Irish folktale, this is the&nbsp;perfect picture book to share on St. Patrick&#x2019;s Day.</strong></p><p>In this classic Irish legend, two harpists&#x2014;merry-hearted Old Pat and ill-spirited Young Tom&#x2014;set off for a contest to name the finest harpist in all of Ireland.

Yet, contrary to popular belief, he never had a set of wooden teeth. Starting at the age of twenty-four, George Washington lost on average a tooth a year, and by the time he was elected president, he had only two left! In this reverentially funny tale written in verse and based on Washington's letters, diaries, and other historical records, readers will find out what really happened as they follow the trail of lost teeth to complete <i>tooflessness</i>. </p><p>Illustrated in watercolors with subtle humor by Brock Cole, the main story is followed by a four-page time line featuring reproduced period portraits of Washington.</p></p><p>The creators of <i>George Washington's Teeth</i> unhinge the jaws of history to examine the mouth of America's first president, tracking the poor man's dental woes as he gallops to war, crosses the Delaware, and, with only two teeth left, takes his place as leader of the country. Washington was plagued by black, rotting teeth from the time he was 22, losing about one a year until he was nearly "toofless" and had to have his first dentures made from a hippotamus tusk (that's right, not wood!). Poets Deborah Chandra and Madeleine Comora begin their quirky historical tale at a lively clip: "The Revolutionary War/ George hoped would soon be won,/ But another battle with his teeth/ Had only just begun..." Indeed. Evidently he was losing teeth even as he crossed the Delaware: "George crossed the icy Delaware/ With nine teeth in his mouth./ In that cold and pitchy dark,/ Two more teeth came out!" (Cleverly, illustrator Brock Cole mimics Emanuel Leutze's famous painting "Washington Crossing the Delaware," making Washington seem more uncomfortably tight-lipped than dignified.) The story ends happily ever after with the crafting of a nice new pair of ivory false teeth that allow George to dance around the ballroom through the night. Truth be told, however, he would be deeply troubled by his teeth until the day he died. A four-page, illustrated historic timeline of Washington's life (and mouth) completes this carefully researched, very funny, charmingly illustrated picture book that works to humanize a larger-than-life historical figure and in turn, history itself. Brilliant! (Ages 7 and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i><p>Deborah Chandra's previous children's books include <i>A is for Amos</i>, which <i>Publishers Weekly</i> called "a charmer" in a starred review.

But compared to surgery or extensive drug regimens with debilitating side effects, the effort is decidedly worth it.</p> <p>Here to make things a bit easier, Dr. Sunil Pai presents a ten-step guide to help you prevent and treat disease through diet and lifestyle changes, as well as through the use of natural anti-inflammatories. With extensive information on the production of food, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements, this remarkable resource pulls back the veil on what&#x2019;s <i>really</i> in the foods and products you consume daily&#x2014;and how they&#x2019;re affecting your health.</p> <p>All too often, conventional health care simply manages diseases rather than actually resolving them. By understanding that inflammation is the underlying trigger mechanism to all ailments, you can learn to prevent, reverse, and treat most chronic illnesses&#x2014;including cancer&#x2014;by applying integrative medicine&#x2019;s natural, evidence-based solutions.</p> <p>Informative, educational, and enlightening, this book will help you understand the truth and motivate you to start taking back your health!</p></p><p><p>Sunil Pai, MD, is board certified in holistic integrative medicine.

Dr. Pai brings an evidence-based, integrative medicine approach to the subject and writes in language that both the layman and the professional will understand. I particularly like his explanations of the various triggering mechanisms of inflammation - diet, pharmaceuticals, allergies, lifestyle and environmental factors. I highly recommend this book. -Andrew Weil, MD, author, <i>Healthy Aging</i> and <i>Spontaneous Happiness</i><br><br>&#x201c;The book &#x201c;An Inflammation Nation&#x201d; authored by Dr. Sunil Pai, MD; is a subject very close to my heart. Almost 40 years of my research and the work of various other groups around the world have been put together very elegantly by Dr. Pai in the form of monograph, which is very easy to understand. This book provides evidence not just in test tube or animals but also in humans that pro-inflammatory life style can lead to various chronic diseases including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and neurological ailments. Most drugs provided by pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to stop these diseases, when the solution lies in simple prevention. Anti-inflammatory life style can both prevent the onset of these diseases as well as slow down the progression of the chronic diseases. Dr. Pai provides evidence that various agents provided by Mother Nature are inexpensive, are very safe and can control dysregulated inflammation. This book by Dr. Pai does an excellent job in describing the role of inflammation and its link to various diseases. This will have a huge impact on our lives and thus highly recommended.&#x201d; &#x2014;Professor Bharat B.

When the gatha ends, we continue our activity with heightened awareness. As exercises in both mediation and poetry, gathas are very much in keeping with the Zen tradition. When you memorize a gatha, it will come to you quite naturally, for example, when you turn on the water or drink a cup of tea.</p><p>Thich Nhat Hanh is one of the most revered Zen teachers in the world today.

Dogs do it. Millipedes do it. Dinosaurs did it. You do it: I do it. Octopuses don&#39;t (and nor do octopi). Spiders might do it: more research is needed. Birds don&#39;t do it, but they could if they wanted to. Herrings do it to communicate with each other. At the beginning of 2017, an innocent question on twitter about snakes formed the hashtag #doesitfart and spread pungently across the internet - and major newspapers - as dozens of experts weighed in on which animals do and don&#39;t fart, and if they do, how much, how often, what it&#39;s made of, what it smells like, and what it&#39;s for. Does it Fart? is the result: the fully authoritative, fully illustrated guide to animal flatulence, covering the habits of 80 animals in more detail than you ever knew you needed. What foods make hyena farts smell especially bad? What is a fossa, and does it fart? Why do clams vomit but not fart? What is a fart, anyway? With contributions from dozens of biologists, Does it Fart? is a book that will allow you to shift the blame onto all kinds of unlikely animals for years to come.</p><p></p><h2>Arifureta: From Commonplace to World&#39;s Strongest (Light Novel) Vol. 7</h2><p><p><b>THE EMPIRE AWAITS!</b></p><p>With the battle at the capital settled, Hajime&#x2019;s next destination is the Empire.

The brilliant, breathtaking conclusion to J.K. Rowling's spellbinding series is not for the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our review--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> is an odyssey the likes of which Rowling's fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissues. <p> The heart of Book 7 is a hero's mission--not just in Harry's quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore's warning about making the choice between "what is right and what is easy," and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling's skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise. </p><p> A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, <i>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</i> is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix's flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience. <i>--Daphne Durham</i> </p><p> <strong>Deluxe Edition Details</strong> <br>The Deluxe Edition includes an exclusive insert featuring near-scale reproductions of Mary GrandPrï¿½'s interior art, as well as never-before-seen full-color frontispiece art on special paper.

Our list features favorite moments, characters, and artifacts from the first five books. Keep in mind that this list is by no means exhaustive (what we love about Harry could fill ten books!) and does not include any of the spectacular revelatory moments that would spoil the books for those (few) who have not read them. Enjoy. <p><strong><i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i></strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Harry's first trip to the zoo with the Dursleys, when a boa constrictor winks at him. <br>* When the Dursleys' house is suddenly besieged by letters for Harry from Hogwarts. Readers learn how much the Dursleys have been keeping from Harry. Rowling does a wonderful job in displaying the lengths to which Uncle Vernon will go to deny that magic exists. <br>* Harry's first visit to Diagon Alley with Hagrid. Full of curiosities and rich with magic and marvel, Harry's first trip includes a trip to Gringotts and Ollivanders, where Harry gets his wand (holly and phoenix feather) and discovers yet another connection to He-Who-Must-No-Be-Named. This moment is the reader's first full introduction to Rowling's world of witchcraft and wizards.<br>* Harry's experience with the Sorting Hat. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i></strong> <br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* The de-gnoming of the Weasleys' garden. Harry discovers that even wizards have chores--gnomes must be grabbed (ignoring angry protests "Gerroff me! Gerroff me!"), swung about (to make them too dizzy to come back), and tossed out of the garden--this delightful scene highlights Rowling's clever and witty genius. <br>* Harry's first experience with a Howler, sent to Ron by his mother. <br>* The Dueling Club battle between Harry and Malfoy. Gilderoy Lockhart starts the Dueling Club to help students practice spells on each other, but he is not prepared for the intensity of the animosity between Harry and Draco. Since they are still young, their minibattle is innocent enough, including tickling and dancing charms. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i></strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Ron's attempt to use a telephone to call Harry at the Dursleys'. <br>* Harry's first encounter with a Dementor on the train (and just about any other encounter with Dementors). Harry's brush with the Dementors is terrifying and prepares Potter fans for a darker, scarier book. <br>* Harry, Ron, and Hermione's behavior in Professor Trelawney's Divination class. Some of the best moments in Rowling's books occur when she reminds us that the wizards-in-training at Hogwarts are, after all, just children. Clearly, even at a school of witchcraft and wizardry, classes can be boring and seem pointless to children. <br>* The Boggart lesson in Professor Lupin's classroom. <br>* Harry, Ron, and Hermione's knock-down confrontation with Snape. </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i></strong><br> </p><table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td>* Hermione's disgust at the reception for the veela (Bulgarian National Team Mascots) at the Quidditch World Cup. Rowling's fourth book addresses issues about growing up--the dynamic between the boys and girls at Hogwarts starts to change. Nowhere is this more plain than the hilarious scene in which magical cheerleaders nearly convince Harry and Ron to jump from the stands to impress them. <br>* Viktor Krum's crush on Hermione--and Ron's objection to it. <br>* Malfoy's "Potter Stinks" badge. <br>* Hermione's creation of S.P.E.W., the intolerant bigotry of the Death Eaters, and the danger of the Triwizard Tournament. Add in the changing dynamics between girls and boys at Hogwarts, and suddenly Rowling's fourth book has a weight and seriousness not as present in early books in the series. Candy and tickle spells are left behind as the students tackle darker, more serious issues and take on larger responsibilities, including the knowledge of illegal curses.</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix</i></strong><br> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td> </td> <td>* Harry's outburst to his friends at No. 12 Grimmauld Place. A combination of frustration over being kept in the dark and fear that he will be expelled fuels much of Harry's anger, and it all comes out at once, directly aimed at Ron and Hermione. Rowling perfectly portrays Harry's frustration at being too old to shirk responsibility, but too young to be accepted as part of the fight that he knows is coming. <br>* Harry's detention with Professor Umbridge. Rowling shows her darker side, leading readers to believe that Hogwarts is no longer a safe haven for young wizards. Dolores represents a bureaucratic tyrant capable of real evil, and Harry is forced to endure their private battle of wills alone. <br>* Harry and Cho's painfully awkward interactions. Rowling clearly remembers what it was like to be a teenager. <br>* Harry's Occlumency lessons with Snape. <br>* Dumbledore's confession to Harry.</td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><p> <strong><i>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</i></strong><br> </p><p> </p><table> <tbody><tr><td> </td> <td>* The introduction of the Horcrux. <br>* Molly Weasley asking Arthur Weasley about his "dearest ambition." Rowling has always been great at revealing little intriguing bits about her characters at a time, and Arthur&#x2019;s answer "to find out how airplanes stay up" reminds us about his obsession with Muggles.<br>* Harry's private lessons with Dumbledore, and more time spent with the fascinating and dangerous pensieve, arguably one of Rowling&#x2019;s most ingenious inventions.<br>* Fred and George Weasley&#x2019;s Joke Shop, and the slogan: "Why Are You Worrying About You-Know-Who? You Should Be Worrying About U-NO-POO--the Constipation Sensation That's Gripping the Nation!"<br>* Luna's Quidditch commentary. Rowling created scores of Luna Lovegood fans with hilarious and bizarre commentary from the most unlikely Quidditch commentator.<br>* The effects of Felix Felicis.</td></tr> </tbody></table> <p> </p><p> </p><p> <strong>Magic, Mystery, and Mayhem: A Conversation with J.K.

J.K. Rowling is very descriptive in her writing--she gives an illustrator a lot to work with. Each story is packed full of rich visual descriptions of the atmosphere, the mood, the setting, and all the different creatures and people. She makes it easy for me. The images just develop as I sketch and retrace until it feels right and matches her vision." Check out more <i>Harry Potter</i> art from illustrator Mary GrandPrï¿½. <br><br></p><p>J. K.

Black parents bear witness to the myriad of problems their children face at school and are becoming increasingly frustrated with the inability to implement positive and constructive change. Many understand the immense value an education provides and understand its empowering effects in the lives of their children. However, as traditional systems of education fail their children, they feel they have no alternatives.As a Black mother, Myiesha experienced this first-hand. As she noticed her daughter, Haley, lose her passion for learning in public school, she made the bold decision to simply pull her out and homeschool her. Homeschooling is fraught with myths and misconceptions and with this how-to guide, memoir fusion, Haley and Myiesha offer insight and enlighten readers on the &#x201c;real deal&#x201d; of homeschooling.

This investigation determines that valid, non-rational experiences are as poignant in the development of knowledge - yet how do we quantify and apportion value to various rational arguments for faith, and the experiences so many believers have had over the millennia? <br><br> The author delves into these arguments, and valiantly attempts to determine how the divine interacts with various emotions. He coins the term 'numinous' from the root word 'numen', to denote an emotional state of consciousness apt to receive spiritual insight. The many emotions and attuning of the soul to God falls under the designation, and it proved to be one of the most important ideas Otto would ever advance. <br><br> <i>The Idea of the Holy</i> remains an important text for students of both philosophy and religion, as well as spiritually inclined readers. Although Christian believers will profit from its concepts and deep discussion of spiritual matters, those of a different faith or of none often come to respect the intricacy and depth with which Otto explains and qualifies his theology in rational and non-rational terms. <br><br> This edition contains the text of the original first translation to English of 1923 by John W. Harvey, who strived to preserve the clarity, concision and poise of Otto's lessons. Since the book was originally published in German in 1918, it has been translated into over twenty different languages.</p><p></p><h2>The Mitford Murders: A Mystery (The Mitford Murders, 1)</h2><p><p><b>"A real murder, a real family and a brand new crime fiction heroine are woven together to make a fascinating, and highly enjoyable, read.

Curated by the PUNCH editorial team with the help of its network of top bartenders, each recipe has been tested and adapted to contemporary tastes, alongside creative tweaks that offer new ways to incorporate the season's flavors into foolproof drinks. PUNCH covers the ins and outs of making a spirit infusion, how to batch drinks for a crowd, how to bottle favorite stirred drinks and freeze them ahead for on-the-fly Manhattans and martinis, three-step syrups and shrubs to keep on hand, and tips and tools to build a winter-ready bar.</p><p>PUNCH is a James Beard Award-winning online magazine devoted to narrative journalism about wine, spirits, beer, and cocktails.INTRODUCTION&nbsp;<br><br>What exactly defines a winter drink? When we look through the history of cocktails, there are a number of drinks that have become synonymous with a season: no one would argue against the daiquiri, the piï¿½a colada, the margarita, or, of late, the spritz as being the cocktail-world equivalents of a &#x201c;Greetings from Paradise&#x201d; postcard. Likewise, when that first hint of winter comes marching in, there are drinks that have historically been its flag bearers.&nbsp;<br><br>Hot toddy. Mulled wine. Spiked cider. Hot buttered rum. Irish coffee. The cocktail world&#x2019;s classic hot drinks have long led that procession&#x2014;they are, after all, drinks quite literally built to fortify us against the cold. But winter drinking today goes far beyond spiking one&#x2019;s mug of steaming liquid with rum or whiskey. The craft cocktail renaissance has cracked open a brave new world of possibilities. Today, a &#x201c;winter drink&#x201d; can span everything from herbal coolers to batched and bottled cocktails for a crowd to concoctions like the daiquiri&#x2014;whose all-important citrus component is, it should be noted, at its prime in winter&#x2014;reimagined with cool weather in mind.&nbsp;<br><br>So, where to start? Many of the drinks that home enthusiasts call on for their winter menus are mere tweaks and riffs on existing classic cocktail blueprints. That&#x2019;s why our exploration of what winter drinking means today begins with the ten essential classic cocktails that feel best suited to winter&#x2014;think the Manhattan, champagne&nbsp;cocktail, old-fashioned, and more. As everyone from the Dalai Lama to Social Distortion has said: Learn the rules before you break them. In cocktails, the same is true. Once you understand the most basic cocktail blueprints, it becomes easy to bend them in order to make them your own.&nbsp;<br><br>To that end, there are just as many best practices as there are hacks and shortcuts in this book. You&#x2019;ll learn the ins and outs of making a spirit infusion; how to batch drinks for a crowd; how to bottle your favorite stirred drinks and freeze them ahead for on-the-fly Manhattans and martinis; three-step syrups and shrubs to keep on hand; and the tips and tools you&#x2019;ll need to build a winter-ready bar. You&#x2019;ll also learn how to turn everything from a piï¿½a colada to a margarita into drinks that feel more at home in a fireside armchair than a beachside lounger. (Believe in the winter piï¿½a colada.)&nbsp;<br><br>This collection of seventy recipes is packed with hot, spiced, and buttered seasonal imperatives, plus plenty of our editors&#x2019; nostalgic favorites and homegrown creations. Our aim, beyond fortifying you against the cold and arming you for the holidays, is to take the best of what we at PUNCH are seeing from today&#x2019;s top bartenders and make it accessible for home bartenders&#x2014;because, after all, that&#x2019;s exactly what we are.</p><h2>The True Meaning of Smekday</h2><p>It all starts with a school essay. <br><br>When twelve-year-old Gratuity ("Tip") Tucci is assigned to write five pages on "The True Meaning of Smekday" for the National Time Capsule contest, she's not sure where to begin. When her mom started telling everyone about the messages aliens were sending through a mole on the back of her neck? Maybe on Christmas Eve, when huge, bizarre spaceships descended on the Earth and the aliens-called Boov-abducted her mother? Or when the Boov declared Earth a colony, renamed it "Smekland" (in honor of glorious Captain Smek), and forced all Americans to relocate to Florida via rocketpod? <br><br>In any case, Gratuity's story is much, much bigger than the assignment. It involves her unlikely friendship with a renegade Boov mechanic named J.Lo.; a futile journey south to find Gratuity's mother at the Happy Mouse Kingdom; a cross-country road trip in a hovercar called Slushious; and an outrageous plan to save the Earth from yet another alien invasion. <br>Fully illustrated with "photos," drawings, newspaper clippings, and comics sequences, this is a hilarious, perceptive, genre-bending novel from best-selling author Adam Rex. <br></p><p>Adam Rex is the<i> New York Times</i> best-selling author and illustrator of <i>Frankenstein Makes A Sandwich.</i> His other books include <i>Pssst!</i>, <i>Moonday</i>, <i>The True Meaning of Smekday</i>, <i>Fat Vampire, </i>and <i>Cold Cereal. </i>He also illustrated the Brixton Brothers series, <i>Billy Twitters and his Blue Whale Problem, </i>and <i>Chloe and the Lion,</i> all by Mac Barnett and <i>Chu's Day </i>by Neil Gaiman. He lives in Tucson, Arizona. Visit him at adamrex.com or follow him on Twitter @MrAdamRex<i>.</i><br><br>Who knew the end of the world could be so hilarious? With a misfit cast of characters led by a precocious 11-year-old narrator named Gratuity &#34;Tip&#34; Tucci and a bumbling alien named J.Lo who has an appetite for dental floss and air fresheners, Rex&#39;s high-octane fantasy could fairly be called an apocalyptic comedy. After the Boov (technologically advanced aliens) conquer Earth (or Smekland, as they call it, after its discoverer), they decide that humans must live on preserves; all Americans must move to Florida. Tip, driving her mother&#39;s car with her cat Pig for a passenger, meets the unexpectedly helpful Boov J.Lo, who, she later discovers, has bungled a mission and is on the lam. Parallels between the Boov and European settlers and their treatment of Native Americans deepen the impact of the story, but the author goes well beyond delivering a single political message. Incorporating dozens of his weird and wonderful illustrations and fruitfully manipulating the narrative structure, Rex skewers any number of subjects, from Disney World to various fleeting fads. Some of the best jokes come from throwaways and from J.Lo&#39;s and Tip&#39;s attempts to understand each other (when Tip asks if his society has boys and girls, he says, &#34;Of course. Do not to be ridicumulous,&#34; and calmly lists the &#34;seven magnificent genders&#34; of the Boov). Picture book aficionados will already know Rex from Frankenstein Makes a Sandwich and Pssst! (reviewed Sept. 10); now another audience can savor his wit. Ages 8-up. (Oct.)

Before he drove from the reserve in his shiny black limousine, Borys Demyanovich Krajnik, who was the senior manager, ordered Maxim Borisovich Melnik--who looked after all the animals on the nature reserve--to run away, too.<br><br> &#x201c;The Germans are coming,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d told Max. &#x201c;Their armies have attacked and invaded the Soviet Union without warning. They&#x2019;ve already taken the great city of Kiev and they will be here soon. Perhaps as early as next week.&#x201d;<br><br> Krajnik was emptying his desk and packing his bags while he was speaking to Maxim Borisovich Melnik and seemed to be preparing to leave.<br><br> &#x201c;But I thought the Germans were our allies,&#x201d; said Max, for much had changed in Ukraine since 1919.<br><br> &#x201c;They were, that&#x2019;s true. But now they&#x2019;re not, see? That&#x2019;s just politics. Doubtless they&#x2019;re after the oil fields of the Crimea. For their war machine. Look, Maxim Borisovich, all you need to know now is that the Germans are fascists and when they get here, they will kill you. Of course, in time our own Red Army will defeat them, but until this happens, you should definitely leave the reserve.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But where shall I go?&#x201d; Max asked Krajnik.<br><br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s your problem, Comrade. But my advice is to go east, toward our own forces. Go east as quickly as you can. However, before you can leave, there&#x2019;s an important order I&#x2019;m giving to you. Very important. It comes from the central committee.&#x201d;<br><br> Max was astounded that the central committee of the Communist Party even knew he still existed, let alone that they had given him an important order. He couldn&#x2019;t help smiling at the very idea of this.<br><br> &#x201c;An order for me? What is it, Comrade?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The committee orders you to slaughter all of the animals on the reserve.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re joking, Borys Demyanovich. Or perhaps the committee is joking.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;The central committee doesn&#x2019;t make jokes, Maxim Borisovich.&#x201d;<br><br> The smile disappeared from Max&#x2019;s old bearded face as quickly as it had arrived. He rubbed his neck thoughtfully; it always seemed to hurt a little when the subject of killing an animal came up.<br><br> &#x201c;Kill all our animals, you say?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;All of them.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;What--the zebras? The ostriches? The llamas?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, Comrade.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Including the Przewalski&#x2019;s horses?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Including the horses.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;For goodness&#x2019; sake, why?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;To stop them from falling into enemy hands, of course. There&#x2019;s enough meat walking around this reserve to feed a small army. Deer, goats, bison, horses, chickens--they&#x2019;re all to be shot. I&#x2019;d help you myself but, er . . . I&#x2019;ve some important orders of my own. I&#x2019;m urgently required in Kharkov. So I have to leave today. Now. As soon as I&#x2019;ve finished talking to you.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;But I couldn&#x2019;t kill our animals, Comrade,&#x201d; said Max. &#x201c;Some of them are very rare. So rare, their species might even become extinct. Not only that, but some of them are my friends.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sentimental nonsense. We&#x2019;re fighting a war, d&#x2019;you understand? And our people are the ones who are facing extinction. The Germans mean to take our land and destroy all of us so that they can live on it. So, if I come back and find that you haven&#x2019;t carried out my orders, I&#x2019;ll call the secret police and have you shot. You&#x2019;ve got a rifle. Now use it.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Very well,&#x201d; said Max, although obviously he had no intention of killing any of the animals; besides, he rather doubted that Borys Demyanovich Krajnik was coming back anytime soon. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it, but I&#x2019;ll do as you say, Comrade.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like it any more than you, Maxim Borisovich, but this is a patriotic war we&#x2019;re fighting. We&#x2019;re fighting for our very survival. It&#x2019;s the Germans or us. From what I hear, they&#x2019;ve already done some terrible things in Poland. So you would do well to be afraid of them.&#x201d;<br><br> And with those words, Krajnik drove away, as quickly as he could.<br><br> Max went outside the house and walked back to his simple cottage on the edge of the steppe.<br><br> The reserve of which he now had full charge was a hidden, enchanted place that consisted of a zoological park and an open territory of steppe covering more than three hundred square kilometers. A wild, desolate-looking region, it is mostly open grassland and largely treeless except for pockets of dense forest growing near rivers and lakes. The steppe is famous for being as bare as the palm of a man&#x2019;s hand, where there abides but rain and cold in winter and baking sun in summer, but in truth, the weather is more unpredictable than that.<br><br> Max did not think he would miss Krajnik very much. One of the reasons the old man was so fond of the reserve was that people like Krajnik were seldom encountered: there were just six small villages in the reserve and the nearest city, Mykolaiv, was more than three hours&#x2019; drive away. Max thought that was just as well, since the whole idea of a nature reserve is to provide a sanctuary from men, where animals can exist without being put to work or hunted for food. In spite of what Krajnik had said about the Germans, the old man had high hopes of them being a real improvement on the Ukrainian Soviet government. And he did not think this hope was unreasonable.<br><br> For one thing, it was a German, not a Ukrainian or a Russian, who had loved animals enough to create the sanctuary at Askaniya-Nova. That same German--the baron Falz-Fein--had been the only man ever to show Max any real kindness. Everything he remembered about the Germans at Askaniya-Nova persuaded Max that if they did turn up and try to kill the animals, he could reason with them. After all, he could speak German, although it had been many years since he&#x2019;d needed to. And so the first thing he did when Krajnik departed from Askaniya-Nova was not to shoot any of the animals but to return to his cottage and look for the German dictionary and grammar book that the baron had given him on his birthday more than forty years ago. And since he had only one small bookshelf with the Bible, a long poem called Eugene Onegin and The Game of Chess by Savielly Tartakower, Max quickly found these books and started to reacquaint himself with the complexities of the German language.<br><br> It was another two weeks before the German SS arrived in trucks and on motorbikes, and took over the main house. They seemed to be in a very good mood and behaved with courtesy when Max presented himself to some of the guards and asked to see the officer in charge. Despite the pirate skull and crossbones on their hats and helmets, they weren&#x2019;t at all frightening to Max. They ushered him into the baron&#x2019;s old study, where he snatched off his cap and introduced himself to a Captain Grenzmann. With his German improving all the time, Max explained that Askaniya-Nova was a nature reserve founded by a German baron, Friedrich Falz-Fein. The captain listened patiently and declared that he was fascinated with Maxim Borisovich&#x2019;s story.</p><h2>NIV, Thinline Bible, Large Print, Bonded Leather, Burgundy, Red Letter, Comfort Print</h2><p><p><strong>Easy to Read.

Andy and his wife, Sandra, have three grown children and live near Atlanta.Joel Manby entered the work force with all the subtlety of a meteor entering the earth&#x2019;s atmosphere. With an MBA from Harvard and tremendous leadership instincts, he was destined, it seemed, to move from one accomplishment to the next.<br><br>Growing up, Joel had watched his father work sunup to sundown plowing fields, mowing lawns, and working in a factory. But somehow the family never seemed to get ahead. With the opportunities Joel had been given to make a better life, he felt a responsibility before God to be a good steward of those prospects. In essence, he felt called by God to achieve his maximum career potential as a servant-leader in business.<br><br>And achieve he did.<br><br>Upon graduating from Harvard, Joel was offered his dream job&#x2014;he was one of the first four people hired for a new General Motors start-up soon to be known as Saturn. As part of this groundbreaking team, Joel distinguished himself in the auto industry.<br><br>Fueled by that early success, Joel moved up quickly through the GM ranks. His skills, gifts, and work ethic made him perfectly suited for high-level executive leadership. He was destined for the top. At the age of thirty-four, he received an incredible offer to become the president of Saab Cars USA. So he left GM to take on a whole new level of demands. Joel excelled in his new position, and with the success came more responsibility.<br><br>Joel was soon put in charge of Saab in Asia, South America, and Canada as well. There seemed to be no limit to his future, but at the same time, there seemed to be no end to his frustration. You see, career wasn&#x2019;t the only arena in which Joel had goals for his life. He and his wife, Marki, had dreams for their family as well. By the time Joel reached his peak at Saab, they had three daughters. While each of Joel&#x2019;s promotions took them a step closer to reaching their financial goals, each demanded more of his time as well. Time that he knew belonged to Marki and the kids.<br><br>Marki embraced her role with the same tenacity Joel exhibited in the marketplace. She was committed to being a team player. She didn&#x2019;t always like the hand she was dealt, but she accepted it and did the best she could. She held down the home front while Joel worked to build a bright future for the family. But there was always the frustration, the loneliness, and at times, the anger.<br><br>As Joel describes it, &#x201c;I was traveling more than 50 percent of the time. There were car shows and dealer meetings all the time. And when I was home, I wasn&#x2019;t really there&#x2014;I had a latenight conference call with Japan or an early-morning conference call with Sweden. In my heart I wanted to be with my family. But I felt like this job was something I had to do. Our family had financial goals, and I felt like God had given me this talent that I should be using. And I viewed each promotion as his reward for a job well done. The truth is, I just couldn&#x2019;t say no. Looking back, it wasn&#x2019;t God prying me away from my family. It was me.&#x201d;<br><br>One day, a close friend called Marki to wish her happy birthday. During their casual conversation, a wave of emotions<br>began to surface, surprising even Marki. It was the second year in a row that Joel had been out of town on her&nbsp; birthday. He hadn&#x2019;t forgotten. He just had a job to do. And she had willingly agreed he should go. But somehow, in that moment, Marki was hit with the reality that the very things they were working so hard to achieve were slipping through their fingers with each passing day.<br><br>In yet another long-distance phone call, Marki confronted Joel with the painful truth that he was not being the husband<br>or father she had signed up for. In the weeks that followed, Joel and Marki had many heart-to-heart conversations. As Joel began to notice the despair in her countenance, he knew he had to make some major changes. Fast.<br><br>&#x201c;I looked at Marki, and she was bawling her eyes out,&#x201d; he explains. &#x201c;I knew that if I continued down this path, I was<br>going to lose my family.&#x201d;<br><br>Joel made a decision right then and there. He didn&#x2019;t have a plan. He wasn&#x2019;t sure how he could pull off the changes necessary to bring balance to his personal life. He didn&#x2019;t know how he could disentangle himself from his involvement in the car industry. But one thing was certain: He refused to keep going in the direction he was going. Things had to get better. Little did he realize just how bad things would get.<br><br>In an attempt to regain control of his life and family, Joel left the international demands of the auto industry for the fastgrowing dot-com world. On the morning of April 4, 2000, Joel began his first day as the CEO of a well-funded Internet startup company, with high hopes for the future. By the end of business on April 4, 2000, it was a very different picture. That day&#x2019;s market plummet marked the beginning of the stock market crash of 2000&#x2013;2002, which caused the loss of five trillion dollars in the market value of companies, as well as the loss of Joe&#x2019;s hopes for an easy answer to the challenges between work and home. In fact, two weeks into the new company, Joel found himself laying off two-thirds of the company&#x2019;s three hundred employees. The emotional toll of firing two hundred people, combined with twenty-hour workdays, led to more sleepless nights. His first attempt to reclaim the life he wanted led to further distance from Marki and greater desperation.<br><br>The remarkable events that followed have had an incredible impact on Joel&#x2019;s life. As he and Marki describe it, the aftermath of Joel&#x2019;s decision to reorder his world was the clearest indication they&#x2019;d ever experienced of God&#x2019;s presence in their lives and marriage.</p><h2>The Cooking for One Cookbook: Over 100 Delicious and Easy Meals Created for One Person (Natural Foods, Quick and Easy Meals, Graduation Gift)</h2><p>Over 100 delicious and easy recipes&#x2014;specifically created as meals for one!<br><br>Step away from that microwave!

From how science is funded, to improving how children are educated -- and nearly everything in-between -- our society has become obsessed with a seductive illusion: that greatness results from doggedly measuring improvement in the relentless pursuit of an ambitious goal. In <i>Why Greatness Cannot Be Planned</i>, Stanley and Lehman begin with a surprising scientific discovery in artificial intelligence that leads ultimately to the conclusion that the objective obsession has gone too far. They make the case that great achievement can't be bottled up into mechanical metrics; that innovation is not driven by narrowly focused heroic effort; and that we would be wiser (and the outcomes better) if instead we whole-heartedly embraced serendipitous discovery and playful creativity.</p><p>Controversial at its heart, yet refreshingly provocative, this book challenges readers to consider life without a destination and discovery without a compass.</p></p><p><p>"What is your ultimate goal - your true objective - when you pick up a book? The authors of this one believe that there may be no objective at all involved, just a diffuse feeling that a book can change the way you look at the world. They may be right."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Christos Papadimitriou, C. Lester Hogan Professor of Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley and Co-author of the New York Times Best Seller &#x201c;Logicomix&#x201d; </p><p>"One of the original aspirations of Artificial Intelligence researchers was to help all of us, as thinking beings, understand ourselves better. Stanley and Lehman are among the few who have managed to achieve this. In this book they not only shed light on a glaring bias in the way we approach the creation of intelligent machines, but have also identified this bias at work in many aspects of our society. It is not every day that a technical book so clearly reveals something new about how we live our own lives and how we might enrich them. I cherish such a rarity, and I urge others to as well.&nbsp;"<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Josh Bongard, Associate Professor of Computer Science, University of Vermont </p><p>"The ideas in this book have revolutionized the field of evolving artificial intelligence. They also help explain why biological evolution, science, and human culture are creative, endlessly innovative processes. Stanley and Lehman's theories are helpful for anyone who wants to foster a culture of innovation in their organization and within their own mind."<br></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Jeff Clune, Director of the Evolving AI Lab and Assistant Professor of Computer Science, University of Wyoming<p></p><p>"Objectives in our lives and careers, and the endeavor to achieve them, can sometimes cause stress and feelings of underachievement. But do we always need objectives? This book challenges common beliefs in our culture and society, revealing indisputable evidence that the biggest discoveries in the arts and sciences are not driven by objectives. The reading provides an uplifting new perspective on creativity, innovation, and happiness."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Andrea Soltoggio, Lecturer in Computer Science, Loughborough University, UK</p><p><b>About the Authors </b></p><p>Kenneth O.

The profession has positioned itself to sit by the phone until we are called upon and commissioned to do work. Architects have long been charged with creating a better-built environment, but it is the developers who dictate what is actually built in our cities. The decisions made by developers before architects are engaged in a project dictate later success. When all of the initial programming, market studies, and cost estimates are based on market averages, it is unsurprising when the final products in our cities are nothing more than average. In the end, architects have devalued their role to the pencil of the developer&#x2019;s vision. By combining Architect &amp; Developer, you can command a greater sense of control, faster decision making, an efficient process, and the potential for a much better profit. The largest hurdle to becoming an architect as developer is that first project. An entrepreneurial mindset and willingness to take risk is required. What developers do is not difficult, you need only have an appetite for risk.I sat down with over a dozen separate architects who are self-initiating their work. Some were doing this as a side hustle while holding down a nine-to-five job, some were small studios that were dipping their toes into the development game, and some were full-blown Architects &amp; Developers. I wanted to absorb what they have learned throughout the process and consolidate the information into a digestible format.

The Blood Gospel.<br><br>An earthquake in Masada, Israel, kills hundreds and reveals a tomb buried in the heart of the mountain. A trio of investigators--Sergeant Jordan Stone, a military forensic expert; Father Rhun Korza, a Vatican priest; and Dr. Erin Granger, a brilliant but disillusioned archaeologist--are sent to explore the macabre discovery, a subterranean temple holding the crucified body of a mummified girl.<br><br>But a brutal attack at the site sets the three on the run, thrusting them into a race to recover what was once preserved in the tomb's sarcophagus: a book rumored to have been written by Christ's own hand, a tome that is said to hold the secrets to His divinity. The enemy who hounds them is like no other, a force of ancient evil directed by a leader of impossible ambitions and incalculable cunning.<br><br>From crumbling tombs to splendorous churches, Erin and her two companions must confront a past that traces back thousands of years, to a time when ungodly beasts hunted the dark spaces of the world, to a moment in history when Christ made a miraculous offer, a pact of salvation for those who were damned for eternity.<br><br>Here is a novel that is explosive in its revelation of a secret history. Why do Catholic priests wear pectoral crosses? Why are they sworn to celibacy? Why do the monks hide their countenances under hoods? And why does Catholicism insist that the consecration of wine during Mass results in its transformation to Christ's own blood? The answers to all go back to a secret sect within the Vatican, one whispered as rumor but whose very existence was painted for all to see by Rembrandt himself, a shadowy order known simply as the Sanguines.<br><br>In the end, be warned: <i>some books should never be found, never opened--until now</i>.</p><p><b>About James Rollins</b><br><br>JAMES ROLLINS is a #1 New York Times bestselling author of international thrillers that have been translated into more than forty languages. Known for unveiling unseen worlds, scientific breakthroughs, and historical secrets, Rollins' knack for breakneck pacing and stunning originality has been hailed by critics and embraced by scores of millions of readers around the world.<br><br><b>The Critics Rave</b><br><br>The New York Times says that his "roguish charm comes from his efforts to persuade readers the story is credible [through] real-life sources for his novel's science, history and geography." Rollins' rare blend of action, suspense, and knowledge was also mentioned by the Huffington Post, which stated that "After Crichton passed away in 2008 he clearly passed the baton to James Rollins, who like Crichton, is a renaissance man."<br><br>NPR calls his work "adventurous and enormously engrossing..." and the New York Journal of Books had this to say: "If you're a fan of smart, entertaining adventure fiction, this is your summer beach read writ large....All the science, all the history, and all the locations are masterfully intertwined. The characters are multi-dimensional. And the story is, well, a corker."<br><br><b>The Story Teller's Story</b><br><br>As a boy immersed in the scientific adventures of Doc Savage, the wonders of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, and pulps such as The Shadow, The Spider, and The Avenger, James Rollins decided he wanted to be a writer. He honed his storytelling skills early, spinning elaborate tales that were often at the heart of pranks played on his brothers and sisters.<br><br>Before he would set heroes and villains on harrowing adventures, Rollins embarked on a career in veterinary medicine, graduating from the University of Missouri and establishing a successful veterinary practice. This hands-on knowledge of medicine and science helps shape the research and scientific speculation that set James Rollins books apart.<br><br><b>Explosive Page-Turning Adventures</b><br><br>The exotic locales of James Rollins novels have emerged as a hybrid between imagination, research, and his extensive travels throughout the United States and Europe, as well as New Zealand, the South Pacific, China, Southeast Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America. Recent jaunts include book tours and stops across the country and several European nations to give talks, seminars, and media interviews.In recent years, much of James' travel has involved meeting readers in small and large groups, at writing and fan conferences, and even aboard seagoing "seminars." James' mentoring and coaching skills have made him a sought after writing instructor and guest speaker for workshops, symposia, conventions, and other forums throughout the country.<br><br>James Rollins is the author of nine thrillers in the bestselling Sigma Force series (Sandstorm, Map of Bones, Black Order, The Judas Strain, The Last Oracle, The Doomsday Key, The Devil Colony, Bloodline, and The Eye of God); six individual adventure thrillers; and the Jake Ransom middle grade series (Jake Ransom and the Skull King's Shadow, Jake Ransom and the Howling Sphinx.)In a masterwork of international adventure, supernatural mystery, and apocalyptic prophecy, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling authors James Rollins and Rebecca Cantrell open the next chapter in a world of shadow and light, of salvation and damnation, where the fate of the heavens is locked within a child of....<br> <br><b>Innocent Blood</b><br><br> A vicious attack at a ranch in California thrusts archaeologist Erin Granger back into the folds of the Sanguines, an immortal order founded on the blood of Christ and tasked with protecting the world from the beasts haunting its shadows and waiting to break free into the sunlight. &nbsp;Following the prophetic words found in the Blood Gospel--a tome written by Christ and lost for centuries--Erin must join forces with Army Sergeant Jordan Stone and the dark mystery that is Father Rhun Korza to discover and protect a boy believed to be an angel given flesh.<br><br> But an enigmatic enemy of immense power and terrifying ambition seeks the same child--not to save the world, but to hasten its destruction. &nbsp;For any hope of victory, Erin must discover the truth behind Christ's early years and understand His first true miracle, an event wrapped in sin and destruction, an act that yet remains unfulfilled and holds the only hope for the world. <br><br> The search for the truth will take Erin and the others across centuries and around the world, from the dusty plains of the Holy Land to the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean, from the catacombs of Rome to an iron fortress in the Mediterranean Sea, and at last to the very gates of Hell itself, where their destiny--and the fate of mankind--awaits.<br><br> With The Blood Gospel, the first novel in the Order of the Sanguines series, James Rollins and Rebecca Cantrell breathtakingly combined science, myth, and religion and introduced a world where miracles hold new meaning and the fight for good over evil is far more complicated than we ever dreamed. In Innocent Blood they again take us to the edge of destruction . . . and into the deepest reaches of imagination.</p><h2>Keto Meal Prep: Easy, Healthy and Wholesome Ketogenic Meals to Prep, Grab, and Go. 21-Day Keto Meal Plan for Beginners.

The audience will also appreciate the colorful visual gags such as Edna's feathered behind disappearing off the page as she torpedoes from the T. rex's mouth. VERDICT Funny, colorful, and different. Try this with Rachael Mortimer's The Three Billy Goats Fluff for a pairing featuring wily animals that save the day.&#x2014; Henrietta Verma, National Information Standards Organization, Baltimore</p><h2>Prehistoric Actual Size</h2><p>What is it like to come face-to-face with the ten-foot-tall terror bird? Or stare into the mouth of the largest meat eater ever to walk the earth? Can you imagine a millipede that is more than six feet long, or a dinosaur smaller than a chicken? In this &#x201c;actual size&#x201d; look at the prehistoric world, which includes two dramatic gatefolds, you&#x2019;ll meet these awe-inspiring creatures, as well as many others.</p><p><b>Steve Jenkins</b> has written and illustrated many nonfiction picture books for young readers, including the Caldecott Honor&#x2014;winning <i>What Do You Do with a Tail Like This?</i> His books have been called stunning, eye-popping, inventive, gorgeous, masterful, extraordinary, playful, irresistible, compelling, engaging, accessible, glorious, and informative. He lives in Boulder, Colorado, with his wife and frequent collaborator, Robin Page, and their children.PreSchool-Grade 5&#x2013;The exciting artistic presentation that worked so well in <i>Actual Size</i> (Houghton, 2004) is equally successful when applied to prehistoric creatures. Progressing chronologically from a dot-sized protozoan of 550 million years ago, Jenkins has chosen the animals and the portions of them to depict to great effect. Cut- and torn-paper figures reveal texture and delicate details, from the long wings of an early dragonfly to the feathered tuft of an eight-foot terror bird. A three-inch spiny shark stands out distinctly against a page of white space, while less than half of a giant millipede barely fits across two pages. A series of foldout pages reveals one complete small dinosaur (<i>Saltopus</i>), the impressive beak and head of a flying reptile (<i>Dsungaripterus</i>), and the thick claw of a fish-eating dinosaur (<i>Baryonyx</i>). Besides the sheer visual impact, the illustrations often highlight features mentioned in the brief text, such as the sharp beak of <i>Protoceratops</i>. Closing pages offer more information about each species, along with spot illustrations that provide the full-body view necessarily lacking from many of the actual-size renderings. Only 5 of the 17 animals are actual dinosaurs, and the inclusion of mammals, insects, and other groups emphasizes the diversity of life forms over this vast prehistoric span. The largest animal shown is also the most dramatic: the top and bottom teeth of <i>Giganotosaurus</i> fill an entire spread. Sure to elicit plenty of Wows from the 560's aisle.<i>&#x2013;Steven Engelfried, Beaverton City Library, OR</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The tiny one&#x2014;the story of us&#x2014;is as brief as the blink of an eye. Yet somehow our infatuation with our own little story&#x2014;and our determination to make it as big as we possibly can&#x2014;blinds us to the massive God Story that surrounds us on every side.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a little like me being shocked a few weeks ago by the reaction of two of New York City&#x2019;s finest as they motioned<br>me over to their squad cars in the middle of my midmorning run. The first officer&#x2019;s opening line (the exact wording of which, I&#x2019;m sad to say, cannot be repeated here) led to the inexcusable reply,<br><br>&#x201c;What does it look like I&#x2019;m doing?&#x201d;<br><br>I quickly realized I had said the wrong thing, especially to a New York cop. In a heartbeat my hands were on the hood of his car and threats of arrest were flying all over the place. I was startled and unnerved, and though it was now too late, my mouth was shut. Unless asked, I wasn&#x2019;t saying another word, especially a sarcastic one.<br><br>To make matters worse, all I could produce in the way of identification was a hotel key card&#x2014;one of those fancy&nbsp;new ones that looks cool but doesn&#x2019;t even contain the name and address of the hotel. The whole scene was going downhill<br>fast...<br><br>Things had started off innocently enough that morning as I headed out the door of our midtown-Manhattan hotel and began plodding down the sidewalk toward the East River about eight blocks away. But before I was two or three blocks<br>away it started to rain. First it was just annoying&#x2014;an intermittent spitting kind of rain. Then the wind picked up and<br>a steady, chilling downpour started making things miserable. Assessing the situation, I determined I was too far from the hotel to make turning back a sensible option, so I kept running north along the river, pressing on in the driving rain.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know what kind of shape you&#x2019;re in, but when I run I think more about survival than scenery. And when I&#x2019;m running in a cold downpour, I barely think at all. I certainly don&#x2019;t look around to read a lot of the signs. Thus, I wasn&#x2019;t paying much attention when suddenly my path was blocked by a chain-link fence. It stretched from the riverbank on my right to a concrete lane divider that had been following me on my left. Once again I considered my options. Retracing my steps still didn&#x2019;t make sense. What made sense was getting out of the rain. So without thinking I hopped over the lane divider and headed for the shelter of an overpass I now noticed across the way.<br><br>Quickly the overpass turned into an elevated roadway, so I could keep running under cover. I continued north,&nbsp;not really noticing that the lane to my right at some point became two lanes of traffic, and then three. After another mile or so, all three lanes of traffic were moving slower than I was and a driver in one of the cars shouted something in my direction. But in the rain and traffic, I couldn&#x2019;t quite make out her words and was trying to ignore her anyway. Then the overpass drifted away to the left and I was once again exposed to the rain.<br><br>Soon I noticed the lower levels of the United Nations buildings on my far left, and nearer and just ahead two police cars parked on a wide concrete median. A single officer sat in each car, their eyes meeting mine as each step I ran drew us closer. Everything seemed to be fine, until my forward progress was interrupted by the piercing &#x201c;<i>blurp&#x201d; </i>of one of the officer&#x2019;s sirens and the intense motion of his hand directing me to approach his car.<br><br>It was at that moment I realized for the first time I was running down the middle of the FDR, a six-lane expressway<br>that snakes along the eastside shoreline of Manhattan. No wonder the officer&#x2019;s first question when I finally splashed to a stop in front of his car was incredulous and unprintable.<br><br>How can you run down the middle of a New York freeway and not know it? I think the same way you can live your entire life completely oblivious to the grand story of the Creator of the universe that is unfolding all around you. The same way you can spend your days making so much of someone as small and transient as you or me, and so little of someone as glorious and eternal as God.<br><br>That&#x2019;s why this book is not about you and making your story better, but about waking up to the infinitely bigger God Story happening all around you, and God&#x2019;s invitation to you to join Him in it. It&#x2019;s about looking up to see that there&#x2019;s a story that has been going on long before you arrived on the planet and one that will go on long after you&#x2019;re gone. God is the central character of this story and of this book. He commands center stage in existence, Creation, time, life, history, redemption, and eternity.<br><br>I&#x2019;m not trying to put you down or imply that you don&#x2019;t matter. Nor am I saying that you are absent from the grand Story of God. In fact, just the opposite. Amazingly, you appear on every page, existing in God&#x2019;s thoughts long before<br>this world was made. I&#x2019;m simply stating the obvious&#x2014;that THE STORY ALREADY HAS A STAR, AND THE STAR IS NOT YOU OR ME.<br><br>And here&#x2019;s why it matters&#x2014;if we don&#x2019;t get the two stories straight, everything else in our lives will be out of sync. We&#x2019;ll spend our days trying to hijack the Story of God, turning it into the story of us. Inverting reality, we&#x2019;ll live every day as though life is all about you and me. We&#x2019;ll live as though life is our one-act play and history our story&#x2014;as though Creation is our habitation alone, existence our playground, and God our servant (that is, if we decide we need Him at all). We will throw every ounce of our energy into the fragmented and fleeting story of us. Calling the shots ourselves, me-centered thinking will dictate every move we make and how we feel.<br><br>And in the end&#x2014;when the last clap is clapped for our tiny tale&#x2014;our story will fade to black, a pitiful return on<br>our one-shot chance called &#x201c;life on earth.&#x201d; <br><br>About thirty minutes into my ordeal with the officers, the situation lightened a bit as I realized the worst that was going to happen to me was a ticket for jaywalking, something I certainly deserved. As we were waiting for my life&#x2019;s history to appear on the squad car&#x2019;s computer, the nicer of the two cops asked within earshot of the other, &#x201c;So what do you do for a living, anyway?&#x201d;<br><br>Hmmm.<br><br>Opting for the short answer, I said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a pastor.&#x201d; Two sets of eyebrows rose.<br><br>&#x201c;A pastor! What kind of pastor are you?&#x201d;<br><br>I think he was looking for the name of a denomination, but I replied, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a Christian.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yeah? Well what are you doing in New York?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to speak to a group of college students tonight out in Queens.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So, what are you going to tell them?&#x201d;<br><br>For a split second time stood still. And then I told him, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to remind them that life is short and our time on earth is really brief,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why we have to make sure our lives count for the stuff that lasts forever.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s what I want to do in these pages, too. Lead you to a fresh awareness of the six-lane-wide-freeway-sized God Story that you and I are running down the middle of every day.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a place that requires a constant choice. We can choose to cling to starring roles in the little-bitty stories of us, or we can exchange our fleeting moment in the spotlight for a supporting role in the eternally beautiful epic that is the Story of God.<br><br>Think of it as trading up. Abandoning the former and embracing the latter will allow our little lives to be filled with the wonder of God as we live for His fame and the unending applause of His name. And joining our small stories to His will give us what we all want most in life anyway: the assurance that our brief moments on earth count for something in a story that never ends.</p><h2>One Sketch a Day: A Visual Journal</h2><p>This charming keepsake sketchbook features spaces to draw each day for one year.

Now in paperback and newly updated for the age of Trump, Brookings Institution senior fellow Richard Reeves is continuing to challenge the class system in America.</p><p>In America, everyone knows that the top 1 percent are the villains. The rest of us, the 99 percent&#x2015;we are the good guys. Not so, argues Reeves. The real class divide is not between the upper class and the upper middle class: it is between the upper middle class and everyone else.</p><p>The separation of the upper middle class from everyone else is both economic and social, and the practice of &#x201c;opportunity hoarding&#x201d;&#x2015;gaining exclusive access to scarce resources&#x2015;is especially prevalent among parents who want to perpetuate privilege to the benefit of their children. While many families believe this is just good parenting, it is actually hurting others by reducing their chances of securing these opportunities. There is a glass floor created for each affluent child helped by his or her wealthy, stable family. That glass floor is a glass ceiling for another child.</p><p>Throughout <i>Dream Hoarders</i>, Reeves explores the creation and perpetuation of opportunity hoarding, and what should be done to stop it, including controversial solutions such as ending legacy admissions to school. He offers specific steps toward reducing inequality and asks the upper middle class to pay for it.</p><p>Convinced of their merit, members of the upper middle class believes they are entitled to those tax breaks and hoarded opportunities. After all, they aren&#x2019;t the 1 percent. The national obsession with the super rich allows the upper middle class to convince themselves that they are just like the rest of America. In <i>Dream Hoarders</i>, Reeves argues that in many ways, they are worse, and that changes in policy and social conscience are the only way to fix the broken system.</p></p><p>This book seems to have hit a nerve. Even when people don&#39;t agree with me (and a lot of people do not) I feel good if the conversation about inequality becomes a bit more personal, and a bit less focused on the super-rich. Very pleased it made it onto the Economist list of Books of the Year 2017.America is becoming a class-based society America prides itself on being a classless society, where hard work and talent get you ahead. A place where status is earned, not inherited. At least, that&#x2019;s the idea. In fact, the United States is marked by a deepening class divide. Debates about inequality focus on the wealth of &#x201c;super-rich,&#x201d; or the top 1 percent. But as Richard Reeves shows, the most important and consequential gap in American society is the one between the upper middle class&#x2015;broadly, the top fifth&#x2015;and everyone else. The separation of the upper middle class can be seen in the income distribution, but also in family structure, neighborhoods, attitudes, and lifestyle. This is not just an economic divide but a fracturing of American society along class lines. Reeves shows how high-income parents are now passing on their class status to their children, threatening American ideals of equal opportunity and social mobility. Upper-middle-class children become upper-middle-class adults; class separation becomes class perpetuation. &#x201c;For Americans,&#x201d; Reeves writes, &#x201c;this should set alarm bells ringing.&#x201d; The upper middle class succeeds by accumulating skills and qualifications, but also by engaging in various forms of &#x201c; opportunity hoarding,&#x201d; which make it harder for others to rise up to the top. These unfair mechanisms include zoning laws, college admissions procedures, and the allocation of internships. The result is a less competitive economy, Reeves argues, as well as a less open society. Inequality is natural, even desirable, when it results from fair competition. Class gaps that result from unfair advantage, however, generate legitimate resentment from those who are excluded. It is not too late to close the gap, however. Reeves outlines practical steps toward restoring opportunity and weakening class distinctions. This fascinating book shows how American society has become the very class-defined society that earlier Americans rebelled against&#x2015;and what can be done to restore a more equitable social order.</p><h2>Who Were The Three Stooges? (Who Was?)</h2><p><b>Discover more about the comedy team that perfected the art of the pie fight!</b><br><br>The Three Stooges were the hardworking children of immigrants and discovered a love of performing at an early age. Starting out as a vaudeville act, they soon transitioned into movies, becoming a worldwide sensation in feature films and shorts. Never the critics' darlings, audiences loved them for their mastery of physical comedy and their willingness to do anything for a laugh. They remained popular over the years despite several personnel changes that revolved around the three Howard brothers from Brooklyn. Their comedies are still in syndication more than 50 years after they were first shown on TV and continue to delight old fans and attract new ones.</p><p>Pamela Pollack and Meg Belviso are authors of several books in this series, including <i>Who Is George Lucas?</i>, <i>Who Was Alfred Hitchcock?</i>, and <i>Who Was Susan B. Anthony?</i><b>Who Were the Three Stooges?</b><br> &nbsp;<br> On September 28, 1934, a new film premiered at the Carthay Circle Theatre in Los Angeles. It was only eighteen minutes long&#x2014;short enough to be shown before the main feature.<br> &nbsp;<br> The movie was called <i>Men in Black</i> and it had three unusual stars. Their names were Moe Howard, Larry Fine, and Curly Howard. Together they were called the Three Stooges. They were a strange-looking trio. Moe had straight black hair that sat like an upside-down bowl on top of his head. Larry&#x2019;s frizzy hair stuck out on all sides. Curly had a head like a cue ball&#x2014;he had no hair at all!<br> &nbsp;<br> Moe had a tough face like a gangster that he scrunched up when he made a fist and barked things like, &#x201c;Why, I oughta&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Larry jumped whenever he was frightened.<br> &nbsp;<br> Curly ran around in circles&#x2014;sometimes even while lying on the floor, like a human pinwheel. He made funny sounds&#x2014;&#x201c;Nyuk nyuk nyuk!&#x201d; and &#x201c;Woo woo woo woo!&#x201d; When he spoke he had a high, squeaky voice. &#x201c;Soitenly!&#x201d; Curly said in his thick Brooklyn accent when he was sure about something. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just a victim of soi-cumstance!&#x201d; he said when he wasn&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the movie, Moe, Larry, and Curly played doctors&#x2014;but they didn&#x2019;t cure many patients. They rode bicycles, horses, and tiny cars through the halls of the hospital. They broke windows and knocked people over the head with mallets. Mostly they fought with one another.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Why, I oughta&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !&#x201d; Moe growled before slapping Curly on the head and poking him in the eye. Larry shrieked as Moe pulled him by the hair. &#x201c;Nyuk nyuk nyuk!&#x201d; Curly said. Then he ran down the hall, hooting, &#x201c;Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> None of the Three Stooges were hurt in their fights. It was all part of their comedy act. The three men would do anything for a laugh. And the audience loved it.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Men in Black</i> was the official movie debut of the Three Stooges. But the three men had known one another for years. Curly was Moe&#x2019;s little brother. Larry was practically part of the family, too. They would go through good times and bad in their lives, but they always stuck together. They were closer than brothers&#x2014;they were Stooges!<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br><b> Chapter 1: A Brooklyn Beginning<br> &nbsp;</b><br> In 1897, Brooklyn, New York, was a city full of immigrants&#x2014;people who had come from other countries to make a new life in America. Jennie and Solomon Horwitz had traveled by boat from Lithuania to New York City. When Sol wasn&#x2019;t working in a clothing factory, he spent as much time as he could at the local synagogue, studying the Jewish holy books and praying. Jennie was a woman ahead of her time. She made most of the money for the family, renting out rooms and later becoming a successful real estate agent.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Moses Harry Horwitz was born on June 19, 1897, he already had three older brothers: Irving, Benjamin (known as Jack), and Sam. Sam, who was two years older than Moses, was always known as Shemp because of the way his mother pronounced his name in her Lithuanian accent. Moses quickly became known as Moe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jack and Irving were well-behaved children. Shemp was the clown of the family. In school he was always getting in trouble for making funny faces and drawing pictures. His mother was constantly getting called to the school to talk to Shemp&#x2019;s teachers about his behavior. She spent so much time there that when Shemp graduated from sixth grade, the principal announced (as he gave Shemp his diploma) that &#x201c;This young man did not graduate&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. his mother did.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Shemp&#x2019;s little brother Moe had his own problems in school: bullies. As a little boy Moe had long hair that fell in fat curls to his shoulders. His mother loved getting up early to curl his hair for school. The other kids thought Moe&#x2019;s hair made him look funny. Both boys and girls teased him. Not a day went by when he didn&#x2019;t get into a fight. Even the principal called him the &#x201c;student with the beautiful hair.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Moe never told his mother about the fights. He knew how much she loved his hair, and he loved her.<br> &nbsp;<br> On October 22, 1903, when Moe was six, Jennie had another son. His name was Jerome. Moe nicknamed him Babe. Shemp and Moe were thrilled to have a new brother. Not long after he was born, they took him out for a walk in his baby carriage. To make the ride more fun for the new baby, they took the carriage to the top of a hill and prepared to let it go down at full speed. Luckily, their parents arrived just in time to stop the wild ride.<br> &nbsp;<br> At school, Moe was still fighting off bullies on his own. One day when he was eleven, a boy began to pick on him. Another boy jumped in and punched the bully in the nose. He made him apologize to Moe.<br> &nbsp;<br> After school Moe went over to his new friend&#x2019;s house. The boy&#x2019;s bedroom was full of pictures of boxers and boxing equipment. Moe looked at himself in the mirror. His new friend looked like an ordinary boy. But Moe still had long curls. At that moment Moe made a decision. He picked up a pair of scissors from the dresser. With his eyes closed, he clipped off his curls one by one. When he opened his eyes again the curls were lying on the floor. Moe&#x2019;s hair was flat against his head, the ends crudely chopped. He wasn&#x2019;t going to be bullied anymore.</p><h2>Keeping Your Cool: A Book about Anger (Growing God&#39;s Kids)</h2><p><b>Stories to Encourage Positive Behavior in Small Children<br></b><br>The preschool and kindergarten years are some of the most important formative years of a person's life.

From the train station, you then had to take a bus, but even after adding in walking time, I could make the trip in twenty minutes.</p> <p>I would often drop in on my friend for no particular reason; however, today was different. This time I had a purpose in mind. If I didn&#x2019;t go today, I might not have the chance to see him again for quite some time.</p> <p>His house was in a residential development and was one of the many upscale houses on his street. Some of the others would even qualify as mansions. The area had been forest once, and many of the owners had kept some of the original trees as part of their landscaping. The beech trees and oaks were tall enough to cast shade on the road.</p> <p>Though roads in this part of town weren&#x2019;t particularly narrow, they were all one-way. I guess that this was simply another indication of the residents&#x2019; status.</p> <p>I wasn&#x2019;t particularly surprised when, a few years ago, Hidaka bought a house in this neighborhood. Anyone in the area with any ambition at all dreamed of living here someday.</p> <p>Hidaka&#x2019;s house wasn&#x2019;t one of the mansions, but it was definitely large for a couple with no children. Though the peaked gables on the roof gave it a Japanese look, it had bay windows, an arch over the front door, and flower boxes hanging from the second-story windows that were clearly Western in design. The house was the result of the application of ideas from both husband and wife, I reckoned, although, considering the low brick wall around the house, the balance seemed skewed in the wife&#x2019;s favor. She once admitted to me that she always wanted to live in an old, European-style castle. His wife was odd like that.</p> <p>Correction. His late wife.</p> <p>I walked along the wall, which was laid so only the long sides of the bricks faced the street, and pressed the intercom button by the gate.</p> <p>There was no answer. Then I noticed the Saab was missing from the driveway. <i>Guess he&#x2019;s stepped out,</i> I thought.</p> <p>I was wondering how to pass the time while waiting for him to return when I remembered the cherry tree in Hidaka&#x2019;s garden. The buds had been about 30 percent open the last time I was there, which was ten days ago. I wondered how the buds were coming along.</p> <p>I let myself in through the gate, figuring it wasn&#x2019;t too much of a transgression. The path to the front door split into two along the way, with the offshoot leading toward the south side of the house. I followed that one to the garden.</p> <p>A number of the cherry blossoms had already fallen, but enough were left on the tree to make it worthwhile viewing. That is, it would have been, if it hadn&#x2019;t been for the woman, a woman I didn&#x2019;t know, standing in the garden, looking down at the ground. She was dressed casually, in jeans and a sweater, and had something white and crumpled in her hand.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; I called out.</p> <p>She seemed startled and looked up at me quickly. &#x201c;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d; She showed me what was in her hand: a white hat. &#x201c;The wind caught it and carried it into the garden. I didn&#x2019;t see anyone home&#x2014;I&#x2019;m sorry.&#x201d;</p> <p>She looked to be in her late thirties. Eyes, nose, and mouth small and unremarkable. A plain-faced woman with an unhealthy cast to her skin. For a moment, I wondered about her story, if the wind had really been blowing hard enough to carry a hat.</p> <p>&#x201c;Is there something interesting on the ground there?&#x201d; I asked.</p> <p>She smiled. &#x201c;The grass was growing in so nicely, I wondered how they were taking care of it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I wish I could tell you.&#x201d; I shrugged. &#x201c;This is my friend&#x2019;s house.&#x201d;</p> <p>She nodded. It seemed to me that she&#x2019;d already realized I didn&#x2019;t live here. &#x201c;Sorry for the intrusion,&#x201d; she said quickly, then walked past me to the front gate.</p> <p>About five minutes later I heard a car pulling into the driveway. It was Hidaka. I walked around to the front door to see his navy-blue Saab backing into the garage. Hidaka noticed me standing there and nodded. In the passenger seat, his new wife, Rie, smiled and bowed her head.</p> <p>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said, getting out of the car. &#x201c;I just stepped out to do some last-minute shopping, and the traffic was terrible. Have you been waiting long?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I was enjoying your cherry blossoms.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s left of them.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a beautiful tree.&#x201d;</p> <p>He grinned. &#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s great when it&#x2019;s in bloom, but after that? It&#x2019;s a real pain in the ass. That tree&#x2019;s right next to my office window and you should see the caterpillars.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s lucky you won&#x2019;t be working here for a while.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Anything to escape caterpillar hell. Come on inside. We still haven&#x2019;t packed all the cups so I can at least offer you some coffee.&#x201d;</p> <p>We went in through the arched entryway.</p> <p>Practically everything in the house was already boxed up. Even the paintings had disappeared from the walls.</p> <p>&#x201c;You almost done packing?&#x201d; I asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;All but the office,&#x201d; Hidaka said. &#x201c;Not that we did much of it ourselves. We had the moving company come in a few times.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;re you going to sleep tonight?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I made a reservation at a hotel. The Crown. Except, I might end up sleeping here anyway.&#x201d;</p> <p>We went into his office. It was decent size and looked oddly vacant with just a computer, a desk, and a small bookshelf remaining.</p> <p>&#x201c;I take it you&#x2019;ve got a deadline tomorrow?&#x201d;</p> <p>Hidaka frowned and nodded. &#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s the last in a series. I have to send it to my publisher by fax tonight, if you can believe that. That&#x2019;s why I haven&#x2019;t turned off the phones yet.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;How many pages do you have left to write?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Thirty or so. I&#x2019;ll make it.&#x201d;</p> <p>We sat in a couple of chairs facing each other by the corner of the desk. Rie came in, bringing the coffee.</p> <p>&#x201c;I wonder how the weather is in Vancouver. It&#x2019;s got to be colder than here,&#x201d; I said to both of them.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a completely different latitude, so it&#x2019;s definitely colder.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s nice that it&#x2019;ll be cool in the summer,&#x201d; Rie added. &#x201c;I never liked having to run the air-conditioning all the time.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to think that a cool breeze through the office will help me get more work done, but we both know that&#x2019;s not going to happen,&#x201d; Hidaka said with a grin.</p> <p>&#x201c;You should definitely come visit us, Osamu. We&#x2019;ll take you on a tour,&#x201d; Rie offered.</p> <p>&#x201c;Thanks. I&#x2019;ll take you up on that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Please do.&#x201d; Rie bowed slightly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave you two to it, then.&#x201d; She headed back downstairs.</p> <p>Hidaka stood, coffee cup in hand, and went over to the window. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad I got to see the cherry tree in full bloom at least.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, if it blooms nice next year, I&#x2019;ll take a picture and send it to you in Canada. Do they have cherry trees over there?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No idea. I know there&#x2019;s none near the place I&#x2019;ll be living, at least.&#x201d; He took a sip of his coffee.</p> <p>&#x201c;That reminds me. There was a woman in your garden a little while ago, before you got here.&#x201d; At first, I&#x2019;d been hesitant to tell him.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, yeah?&#x201d; Hidaka frowned.</p> <p>I told him about the woman, and his suspicious frown turned into a wry smile. &#x201c;Did her face look like one of those round-headed, wooden <i>kokeshi</i> dolls?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, now that you mention it, it did.&#x201d; I laughed.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, her last name&#x2019;s Niimi. Lives down the street. She might look young, but she&#x2019;s definitely over forty. Rie thinks she&#x2019;s married, but that her husband works in another city and they have one of those distance-marriage arrangements.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;You seem to know her. Are you friends?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hardly.&#x201d; He opened the window and closed the screen. A warm breeze blew in, carrying with it the smell of leaves. &#x201c;Quite the opposite, actually. I believe she has a grudge against me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A grudge? What for?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A cat. Her cat died the other day. Apparently she found it lying by the road. When she took it to a veterinarian, he told her he thought it had been poisoned.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What does that have to do with you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She thinks I&#x2019;m responsible. That I put out a poisoned meatball and her cat ate it.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Seriously? Why would she think that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, that&#x2019;s the best part.&#x201d; Hidaka pulled a magazine off the bookshelf and opened it. &#x201c;Take a look.&#x201d;</p> <p>It was an essay, entitled &#x201c;The Limits of Patience,&#x201d; and Hidaka&#x2019;s photo was next to the title. The essay was about a cat that had a habit of wandering onto the author&#x2019;s property and bothering him. Every morning, he found cat poop in the garden, pawprints on the hood of his car, and his potted plants shredded. He&#x2019;d seen a white-and-brown-speckled cat around, knew it was the culprit, but could do nothing about it. He&#x2019;d tried everything he could think of but nothing worked. An old wives&#x2019; tale says that cats are afraid of their reflections, so, in desperation, he lined up plastic bottles filled with water in the hope that the cat would see itself in these makeshift mirrors and be scared away. But that didn&#x2019;t work at all. The gist of this short essay was that the limits of his patience were tested daily.</p> <p>&#x201c;And the deceased was a white-and-brown-speckled cat?&#x201d; I asked.</p> <p>&#x201c;Something like that, yeah.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I see. No wonder she thinks you&#x2019;re the culprit.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Last week, she comes over with this dark look on her face. She didn&#x2019;t accuse me of poisoning her cat outright, but she implied it strongly. Rie told her she was crazy and sent her packing. I thought that was end of it&nbsp;&#x2026; but if she&#x2019;s been snooping around in the garden, I must still be her prime suspect. She&#x2019;s probably looking for poisoned meatballs.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Persistent, isn&#x2019;t she?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, women like that always are.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t she know you&#x2019;re moving to Canada?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Rie explained that we were moving to Vancouver in a week, so why would we worry about a cat we only had to deal with a little while longer? She may not look it, but when it comes to a fight, Rie can really dig in.&#x201d; Hidaka laughed deeply.</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, she has a point. I can&#x2019;t see any reason why you guys would bother to kill that cat.&#x201d;</p> <p>For some reason, Hidaka didn&#x2019;t respond right away. He just grinned, looking out the window. He finished his coffee before saying, &#x201c;I did do it, you know.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d; I said, unable to grasp his meaning immediately. &#x201c;Did what?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I killed the cat. I killed it with poisoned meatballs that I put out in our garden. I didn&#x2019;t really think it would work, at least not as well as it did.&#x201d;</p> <p>I thought he was pulling my leg until I saw his face. He was smiling, but it wasn&#x2019;t the kind of smile that went with a joke.</p> <p>&#x201c;Where did you get the poisoned meatballs?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That part was easy. I just mixed in some pesticide with cat food and left them out in the garden. A cat will eat anything, you know.&#x201d; Hidaka put a cigarette in his mouth and lit it, taking a leisurely drag. The smoke dissipated in the breeze coming in through the window.</p> <p>&#x201c;But, why?&#x201d; To tell the truth, I was a little disturbed by this revelation.</p> <p>&#x201c;I told you we haven&#x2019;t found a tenant yet?&#x201d; His cold smile faded.</p> <p>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Our real estate agent&#x2019;s still looking, but when he was here the other day, he said something that bothered me.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t think it made a good impression to have all those plastic bottles lined up in front of the house. It would make people think we had a problem with strays, which would make it hard to rent.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So just throw away the bottles. They didn&#x2019;t work, anyway.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, but that wouldn&#x2019;t solve the basic problem. What happens if someone comes here to check out the place and there&#x2019;s cat shit all over the garden? If we&#x2019;re here, we can clean it up, but what happens once we leave? I can&#x2019;t have the place smelling like a litter box.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;So you killed the cat?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hey, the owner&#x2019;s as responsible for what happened as I am. Not that she seems to understand that at all.&#x201d; Hidaka stubbed out his cigarette in an ashtray.</p> <p>&#x201c;Does Rie know?&#x201d;</p> <p>The corner of his mouth curled up in another smile and he shook his head. &#x201c;Are you kidding? Women love cats. If I told her the truth, she&#x2019;d think I was the devil incarnate.&#x201d;</p> <p>I sat in silence, at a loss for how to respond. Just then, the phone rang and Hidaka picked it up.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hello?&#x2026; Oh, hi. I was wondering when you&#x2019;d call.&#x2026; Yes, all according to schedule.&#x2026; Hey, okay, you got me. I was just about to start.&#x2026; Sure, I should be able to get it done tonight.&#x2026; Right, I&#x2019;ll send it along as soon as it&#x2019;s finished.&#x2026; No, actually, this phone will be out of service after noon tomorrow. I&#x2019;ll have to call you.&#x2026; Yes, from the hotel. Right, bye.&#x201d;</p> <p>He hung up and gave a little sigh.</p> <p>&#x201c;Your editor?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes. My articles are usually late, but this time the stakes are a little bit higher. I mean, if he doesn&#x2019;t get it from me tonight, then he won&#x2019;t have it in time. I&#x2019;ll be out of the country by the day after tomorrow.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well.&#x201d; I stood from my chair. &#x201c;I should probably get going then. I don&#x2019;t want to throw you off schedule.&#x201d;</p> <p>The doorbell rang. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably just a salesman,&#x201d; Hidaka said, but then we heard Rie walking down the hallway, followed by a knock at the office door.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah?&#x201d; Hidaka called out.</p> <p>She opened the door and peered in, a dark look on her face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Ms. Fujio,&#x201d; she said quietly.</p> <p>Hidaka&#x2019;s face clouded over like the sky before a squall. &#x201c;Not her again.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She says it&#x2019;s something she needs to talk to you about today.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Great.&#x201d; Hidaka chewed his lip. &#x201c;She must&#x2019;ve found out we&#x2019;re moving to Canada.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Should I say you&#x2019;re busy?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah&#x201d;&#x2014;then, after a moment of thought&#x2014;&#x201c;no, I&#x2019;ll see her. Might as well get it over with now so I don&#x2019;t have to think about it later. You can let her up.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re sure&#x2026;&#x201d; Rie glanced in my direction.</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, don&#x2019;t worry about me,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I was just leaving.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, this is a fine pickle,&#x201d; Hidaka said with a sigh after she&#x2019;d left the room.</p> <p>&#x201c;Is that Fujio as in Masaya Fujio?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, it&#x2019;s his sister. Her name&#x2019;s Miyako.&#x201d; Hidaka scratched his forehead beneath the longish locks of his hair. &#x201c;If she just wanted some cash, that&#x2019;d be easy enough. But a total recall? Rewrites? Give me a break.&#x201d;</p> <p>More footsteps sounded in the hall. Hidaka&#x2019;s mouth snapped shut. I heard Rie apologizing for the lack of lights. A knock.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d; Hidaka said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ms. Fujio,&#x201d; Rie said, opening the door.</p> <p>Behind her stood a woman in her late twenties. She had long hair and was wearing the kind of suit that college grads wear to their first job interview. For an unexpected visitor, she had put a lot of attention into her presentation.</p> <p>&#x201c;So, I&#x2019;ll see you later,&#x201d; I said to Hidaka. I was about to tell him I&#x2019;d come to see him off the day after tomorrow, but checked myself. I didn&#x2019;t know for sure if Ms. Fujio knew he was leaving and didn&#x2019;t want to rock any boats. Hidaka nodded quietly.</p> <p>Rie walked me to the door. &#x201c;Sorry to rush you out like this.&#x201d; She pressed her hands together apologetically, one eye closed in a wink. She was short and slender enough that the expression made her look like a young girl. It was hard to believe she was over thirty.</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay. I&#x2019;ll come see you off the day after tomorrow.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s all right. We don&#x2019;t want to trouble you. I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;re busy.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s no trouble at all. See you.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Good-bye,&#x201d; she said, and stood watching me as I walked out the gate and turned the corner.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>I was back at my apartment doing a bit of work when the doorbell rang.

But that is no comfort to those crossed out by the editor&#x2019;s pen. For years, science textbooks equated electricity and light with one man, Thomas Edison, while the genius whose pioneering electrical technologies truly power the modern world languished as a minor note in scientific history.</p> <p>Before the turn of the 20th century, electricity remained a mere scientific curiosity. Nikola Tesla, arguably more than anyone else, changed that. But Nikola&#x2019;s pioneering research in electricity represents only a portion of the scientific and technical innovations that elevated him to science godhood.</p> <p>Tesla not only expanded and revolutionized the work of his predecessors, he also leapfrogged ahead of his contemporaries to the next step.</p> <p><em>Nikola Tesla: My Life, My Research</em> has three parts: Tesla&#x2019;s autobiography; Tesla&#x2019;s major research programs explained in simple words; and an eighty-page collection of rare photographs taken at several stages of Tesla&#x2019;s life; from his birth certificate, to the first photograph ever taken by phosphorescent light, to the last known photograph before Tesla&#x2019;s death, in 1943.</p> <p>One volume: 336 pages.</p></p><p></p><h2>Modern Appointment Setting: Prospecting and Phoning for Financial Professionals</h2><p>Modern Appointment Setting is a guide for direct sales people, and financial professionals in particular, who are struggling to get face-to-face appointments in today&#x2019;s world.

Exact facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. This masterwork is much more than a refutation of the economics of socialism (although on that front, nothing else compares). It is also a critique of the entire intellectual apparatus that accompanies the socialist idea, including the implicit religious doctrines behind Western socialist thinking, a cultural critique of socialist teaching on sex and marriage, a refutation of syndicalism and corporatism, an examination of the implications of radical human inequality, an attack on war socialism, and refutation of collectivist methodology. In short, Mises set out to refute socialism, and instead pulled up the socialist mentality from its very roots. For that reason, Socialism led dozens of famous intellectuals, including a young F.A. Hayek, into a crisis of faith and a realist/libertarian political orientation. All the collectivist literature combined cannot equal the intellectual achievement of this one volume.</p><p></p><h2>Infinity: Chronicles of Nick (Chronicles of Nick, 1)</h2><p><p><b>At fourteen, Nick Gautier thinks he knows everything about the world around him. Streetwise, tough, and savvy, his quick sarcasm is the stuff of legends. . .until the night when his best friends try to kill him. Saved by a mysterious warrior who has more fighting skills than Chuck Norris, the teenaged Nick is sucked into the realm of the Dark-Hunters: immortal vampire slayers who risk everything to save humanity.</b></p><br><p> Nick quickly learns that the human world is only a veil for a much larger and more dangerous one: a world where the captain of the football team is a werewolf and the girl he has a crush on goes out at night to stake the undead. But before he can even learn the rules of this new world, his fellow students are turning into flesh-eating zombies--and he's next on the menu.<br> As if starting high school isn't hard enough. . .now Nick has to hide his new friends from his mom, his chain saw from the principal, and keep the zombies and the demon Simi from eating his brains, all without getting grounded or suspended. How in the world is he supposed to do that?</p></p><p><p>In the past two years, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author <b>Sherrilyn Kenyon</b> has claimed the #1 spot twelve times, and since 2004, she has placed more than 50 novels on the <i>New York Times</i> list.

She lives with her husband, three sons, a menagerie of animals and a collection of swords.</p>&nbsp;<p>&#x201c;I am a socially awkward mandork.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nicholas Ambrosius Gautier! You watch your language!&#x201d;</p><p>Nick sighed at his mother&#x2019;s sharp tone as he stood in their tiny kitchen looking down at the bright orange Hawaiian shirt. The color and style were bad enough, the fact it was covered in l-a-r-g-e pink, gray and white trout (or were they salmon?) was even worse. &#x201c;Mom, I can&#x2019;t wear this to school. It&#x2019;s...&#x201d; he paused to think real hard of a word that wouldn&#x2019;t get him grounded for life&#x2013; &#x201c;hideous. If anyone sees me in this, I&#x2019;ll be an outcast relegated to the loser corner of the cafeteria.&#x201d;</p><p>As always, she scoffed at his protest. &#x201c;Oh shush. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with that shirt. Wanda told me at the Goodwill store that it came in from one of those big mansions down in the Garden District. That shirt belonged to the son of a fine upstanding man and since that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m raising you to be...&#x201d;</p><p>Nick ground his teeth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather be a delinquent no one picks on.&#x201d;</p><p>She let out a deep sound of aggravation as she paused while flipping bacon. &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s going to pick on you, Nicky. The school has a strict no bullying policy.&#x201d;</p><p>Yeah, right. That wasn&#x2019;t worth the &#x201c;contract&#x201d; paper it was written on. Especially since the bullies were illiterate idiots who couldn&#x2019;t read it anyway.</p><p>Jeez. Why wouldn&#x2019;t she listen to him? It wasn&#x2019;t like he wasn&#x2019;t the one going into the lion&#x2019;s den everyday and having to traverse the brutality of high school land mines. Honestly, he was sick of it and there was nothing he could do.</p><p>He was a massive loser dork and no one at school ever let him forget that. Not the teachers, the principal and especially not the other students.</p><p>Why can&#x2019;t I flash forward and bypass this whole high school nightmare?</p><p>Because his mom wouldn&#x2019;t let him. Only hoodlums dropped out of school and she didn&#x2019;t work as hard as she did to raise up another piece of worthless scum&#x2013; it was a harped on litany permanently carved into his brain. It ranked right up there with:</p><p>Be a good boy, Nicky. Graduate. Go to college. Get a good job. Marry a good girl. Have lots of grandbabies and never miss a holy day of obligation at church. His mom had already road mapped his entire future with no diversions or pit stops allowed.</p><p>But at the end of the day, he loved his mom and appreciated everything she did for him. Except for this whole, do what I say, Nicky. I&#x2019;m not listening to you because I know better thing, she said all the time.</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t stupid and he wasn&#x2019;t a troublemaker. She had no idea what he went through at school and every time he tried to explain it, she refused to listen. It was so frustrating.</p><p>Gah, can&#x2019;t I catch swine flu or something? Just for the next four years until he was able to graduate and move on to a life that didn&#x2019;t include constant humiliation? After all, the swine flu had killed millions of people in 1918 and several more during outbreaks in the seventies and eighties. Was it too much to ask that another mutant strain of it incapacitate him for a few years?</p><p>Maybe a good bout of Parvo...</p><p>You&#x2019;re not a dog, Nick.</p><p>True, no dog would be caught dead wearing this shirt. Whizzing on it would be another matter...</p><p>Sighing in useless angst, he looked down at the crap shirt he wanted desperately to burn. Okay fine. He&#x2019;d do what he always did whenever his mom made him look like a flaming moron.</p><p>He&#x2019;d own it.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to own this. I look like epically stupid.</p><p>Man-up, Nick. You can take it. You&#x2019;ve taken a lot worse.</p><p>Yeah, all right. Fine. Let them laugh. He couldn&#x2019;t stop that anyway. If it wasn&#x2019;t the shirt, they&#x2019;d humiliate him over something else. His shoes. His haircut. And if all else failed, they&#x2019;d insult his name. Didn&#x2019;t matter what he said or did, those who mocked would mock anything. Because some people were just wired wrong and they couldn&#x2019;t live unless they were making other people suffer.</p><p>His Aunt Menyara always said, no one could make him feel inferior unless he allowed them to.</p><p>Problem was, he allowed it a lot more than he wanted to.</p><p>His mom set a chipped blue plate on the side of the rusted out stove. &#x201c;Sit down, baby, and eat something. I was reading in a magazine that someone left at the club that kids score much higher on tests and do a lot better in school whenever they have breakfast.&#x201d; She smiled and held the package of bacon up for him to see. &#x201c;And look. It&#x2019;s not expired this time.&#x201d;</p><p>He laughed at something that really wasn&#x2019;t funny. One of the guys who came into his mom&#x2019;s club was a local grocer who would give them meat sometimes when it expired since all the guy did was throw it out anyway.</p><p>As long as we eat it quick, it won&#x2019;t make us sick.</p><p>Another litany he hated.</p><p>Picking up the crispy bacon, he glanced around the tiny condo they called home. It was one of four that had been carved out of an old rundown house. Made up of three small rooms- the kitchen/living room, his mom&#x2019;s bedroom and the bathroom- it wasn&#x2019;t much, but it was theirs and his mom was proud of it so he tried to be proud too.</p><p>Most days.</p><p>He winced as he looked at his corner where his mom had strung up dark blue blankets to make a room for him on his last birthday. His clothes were kept in an old laundry basket on the floor set next to his mattress that was covered with Star Wars sheets he&#x2019;d had since he was nine&#x2013; another present his mom had picked up at a yard sale.</p><p>&#x201c;One day, Mom, I&#x2019;m going to buy us a really nice house.&#x201d; With really nice stuff in it.</p><p>She smiled, but her eyes said she didn&#x2019;t believe a word he spoke. &#x201c;I know you will, baby. Now eat up and get to school. I don&#x2019;t want you dropping out like me.&#x201d; She paused as a hurt look flitted across her face. &#x201c;You can see exactly what that gets you.&#x201d;</p><p>Guilt cut through him. He was the reason his mom had dropped out of school. As soon as her parents had learned she was pregnant, they&#x2019;d offered her one choice.</p><p>Give up the baby or give up her nice home in Kenner, her education and her family.</p><p>For reasons he still didn&#x2019;t understand, she&#x2019;d chosen him.</p><p>It was something Nick never let himself forget. But one day he was going to get all that back for her. She deserved it and for her, he&#x2019;d wear this godawful shirt.</p><p>Even if it got him killed...</p><p>And he&#x2019;d smile through the pain of it until Stone and his crew kicked his teeth in.</p><p>Trying not to think about the butt-whipping to come, Nick ate his bacon in silence. Maybe Stone wouldn&#x2019;t be in school today. He could get malaria or the plague, or rabies or something.</p><p>Yeah, may the smarmy freak get a pox on his privates.</p><p>That thought actually made him smile as he shoved the grainy powdered eggs in his mouth and swallowed them. He forced himself not to shiver at the taste. But it was all they could afford.</p><p>He glanced at the clock on the wall and jerked. &#x201c;Gotta go. I&#x2019;m going to be late.&#x201d;</p><p>She grabbed him for a bear hug.</p><p>Nick grimaced. &#x201c;Stop sexually harassing me, Mom. I gotta go before I get another tardy.&#x201d;</p><p>She popped him on the butt cheek before she released him. &#x201c;Sexually harassing you. Boy, you have no idea.&#x201d; She ruffled his hair as he bent over to pick up his backpack.</p><p>Nick put both arms through the straps and hit the door running. He launched himself from the dilapidated porch and sprinted down the street, passed broken down cars and garbage cans to where the streetcar stopped.</p><p>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t be gone...&#x201d;</p><p>Otherwise he&#x2019;d be doomed to another &#x201c;Nick? What are we going to do with you, you white trash dirt?&#x201d; lecture from Mr. Peters. The old man hated his guts and the fact that Nick was a scholarship kid at his snotty over privileged school seriously ticked Peters off. He&#x2019;d like nothing better than to kick him out so that Nick wouldn&#x2019;t &#x201c;corrupt&#x201d; the kids from the good families.</p><p>Nick&#x2019;s lip curled as he tried not to think about the way those decent people looked at him like he was nothing. More than half their dads were regulars at the club where his mom worked, yet they were called decent while he and his mom were considered trash.</p><p>The hypocrisy of that didn&#x2019;t sit well with him. But it was what it was. He couldn&#x2019;t change anyone&#x2019;s mind but his own.</p><p>Nick put his head down and ran full speed as he saw the streetcar stopped at his station.</p><p>Oh man...</p><p>He picked up speed and he broke out into a dead run. He hit the platform and leapt for the streetcar. He&#x2019;d caught it just in time.</p><p>Panting and sweating from the humid autumn New Orleans air, he shrugged his backpack off as he greeted the driver. &#x201c;Morning Mr. Clemmons.&#x201d;</p><p>The elderly African American man smiled at him. He was one of Nick&#x2019;s favorite drivers. &#x201c;Morning, Mr. Gautier.&#x201d; He always mispronounced Nick&#x2019;s last name. He said it Go-chay instead of the correct Go-shay. The difference being Go-chay traditionally had an &#x201c;h&#x201d; in it after the &#x201c;t&#x201d; and as Nick&#x2019;s mom so often said, they were too poor for anymore letters. Not to mention, one of his mom&#x2019;s relatives, Fernando Upton Gautier, had founded the small town in Mississippi that shared his name and both were pronounced Go-shay. &#x201c;Your mom made you late again?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know it.&#x201d; Nick dug his money out of his pocket and quickly paid before taking a seat. Winded and sweating, he leaned back and let out a deep breath, grateful he&#x2019;d made it in time.</p><p>Unfortunatel...</p></p><h2>Kick-Ass: The Dave Lizewski Years Book Two</h2><p>This month marks TEN YEARS OF KICK-ASS -- the greatest superhero comic of all time.

ISBN 978-1-882391-54-7. <p> The new 8th edition of this best-selling bible of the World War II M1 Carbine has been revised and expanded to include an entire chapter devoted to Carbine Magazines, new information in the Carbine oilers section, new sections covering the Tool Roll and Spare Parts Roll, as well as the shipping crate, and additional info on imported M1 Carbines. Additional photos and updated charts have also been added. </p><p> This book is divided into seven chapters and ten appendices. Each chapter describes a major subgroup of the M1 Carbine: receiver, barrel, trigger assembly, stock, accessories, the trench knife and bayonet, and magazines. </p><p> The author, Craig Riesch, has compiled thirty-two years of surveys and research into this 236 page volume. The book contains 43 charts, 231 photographs, and 14 drawings. </p><p> The book provides a history of the M1 Carbine's development, manufacture and use during World War II, as well as through the Korean War and the war in Vietnam. The M1 Carbine is analyzed and described by its ten manufacturers, model and serial number range. The U.S. Army Ordnance Department required that virtually every part of the M1 Carbine be marked with a manufacturer's or subcontractor's code. Riesch has unraveled the manufacturer's and subcontractor's codes by serial number range and eliminated many spurious codes. Every major and most minor part can now be conclusively identified by manufacturer and serial number range, making it possible to examine an M1 Carbine to determine its authenticity with a high degree of confidence. Using the charts and photos the collector can identify the manufacturer and period of use for the receiver group, barrel group, trigger housing group, stock group and their component parts. Butt plates by the various manufacturers are shown in full-size photographs for easy identification. All variations of the M1 Carbine are discussed M1, M1A1, M2, T2 and M3 by manufacturer. The aspects that make up the two types of true M1A1 folding stock paratrooper carbines are described and photographed. Serial number ranges for original manufacture of the M1A1 are also included. Reproduction folding stocks are shown and points of difference are identified so the collector will not be fooled by fakes.</p></p><p>Craig Riesch is a well-known collector and scholar of U.S. military small arms. He is the author of U.S. M1 Carbines, Wartime Production and was the coauthor of The .45-70 Springfield and The M1 Garand, 1936 to 1957. He also edited The American Krag Rifle and Carbine and Swiss Magazine Loading Rifles, 1869 to 1958, all in the For Collectors Only series plus The AK-47 and AK-74 Kalashnikov Rifles in the Shooter s and Collector s series. Both series are guides to antique and collectible modern firearms identification and verification. Mr. Riesch has spent a great deal of time studying U.S. military firearms and is consulted by many collectors for authentication of military and civilian arms. He has been a collector himself for over forty years. Mr. Riesch is a U.S. Army combat veteran and served in Vietnam during the period of the Tet Offensive. He worked for 33 years as a product operations manager for a major defense company.</p><h2>Navigating the Interior Life: Spiritual Direction and the Journey to God (Sophia Institute Spiritual Direction)</h2><p><p>Most of us have questions about spiritual direction.

In this practical book, Thomas Fowler-Finn, an experienced consultant who has worked closely with the Harvard team that pioneered instructional rounds, discusses how facilitators can skillfully guide a network of educators through the rounds process.<br> He shows how to scaffold participant learning, model effective teaching practices, and gradually transfer agency to the network. <i>Leading Instructional Rounds</i> is an invaluable resource for advancing the work of all facilitators, whether novice or experienced.</p><p><b>Thomas Fowler-Finn</b> is the founder of Instructional Rounds Plus, working internationally as a facilitator of instructional rounds, instructional leadership practices and networks, and strategic planning. He is a former superintendent of the Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Fort Wayne, Indiana, public schools.Taking a close look at the original instructional rounds model, Tom has drawn on his own background and carefully documented learning processes, added his own improvements, and codified the process in concise and direct language. Tom minces no words as he outlines what facilitators should do and not do, how to predict the places the rounds practice may go off the rails and become unproductive, and what to do about it. If you are looking for a clear how-to guide to facilitate a tight and well-thought out version of instructional rounds, this is it. --From the foreword by Lee Teitel, lecturer on education, Harvard Graduate School of Education, and coauthor, Instructional Rounds in Education<br><br>Effective instructional rounds is the first step in building collective understanding and responsibility for the success of all students. Thomas Fowler-Finn provides outstanding tools and resources for leveraging the power of instructional rounds to support continuous improvement for all. --Stephanie Hirsh, executive director, Learning Forward<br><br>In 2008, Western Metropolitan Region students in grade five were the lowest performers in literacy and numeracy in Victoria. Four years later, those students ranked third in all measures, despite being the lowest SES cohort in the state. Principals identified participation in instructional rounds, facilitated by Thomas Fowler-Finn, as a key element of the region's success. In rich, challenging, and increasingly trusting collegial discussions, we learned to focus on student learning and how to improve instruction. Leading Instructional Rounds in Education provides a precise, practical, and very usable guide for people facilitating (and doing) instructional rounds. --Katherine Henderson, former regional director, Western Metropolitan Region Department of Education and Early Childhood Development, Victoria, Australia</p><h2>Keep Pain in the Past: Getting Over Trauma, Grief and the Worst That&#x2019;s Ever Happened to You (Depression, PTSD)</h2><p><p><b><strong>Heal Psychological Wounds on Your Own</strong></b></p><p><strong>Move on from the emotional trauma of your past:&nbsp;</strong>Contrary to what many people believe, we can recover from emotional trauma relatively quickly and completely on our own, without thousands of dollars spent on therapists.

The vast array of judo techniques has branched out into three distinct categories: throwing techniques, grappling techniques, and striking techniques. Of these, throwing techniques (nage-waza) represent some of the most dynamic and compelling aspects of this world-famous martial art.<br>Recent developments in competition (shiai) and free practice (randori) have seen an increase in the number of forms of nage-waza, leading to often confusing interpretations of the techniques' names. The purpose of this book, therefore, is to provide a comprehensive and correct classification of nage-waza terminology as used in both competition and practice. All the sixty-seven official Kodokan throwing techniques and their various forms are explained thoroughly and concisely, and over 1,800 photographs accompany the text to provide the reader with the most comprehensive guide to judo's throwing forms to date.<br>For many years author Toshiro Daigo has held the prestigious position of chief instructor at the Kodokan, regarded as the mecca for all judo enthusiasts, and this book is the result of painstaking research into the constantly changing forms of judo's nage-waza. It will be an invaluable resource for practitioners everywhere.</p><p><b>TOSHIRO DAIGO</b> was born in 1926. He graduated from the Tokyo University of Education, and later became the judo champion of Japan in 1951, 1952, and 1954. He has been the chief instructor at the Kodokan for many years, and was the manager of the Japanese judo team at the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, and at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. In 1992 he received the rank of Kodokan 9th dan. He has published several textbooks on judo in Japanese.</p><h2>Brooklyn Then and Nowï¿½</h2><p>Putting archive and contemporary photographs of the same landmark side-by-side, Brooklyn Then and Nowï¿½ provides a visual chronicle of the city's pastBrooklyn possesses a rich history and culture. The Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn Dodgers, and Coney Island are icons as well known as Manhattan's skyline. Home to more than two million people, the borough&#x2014;one of five that comprise New York City&#x2014;has had many faces over the course of its fascinating history. Just across the East River from Manhattan, Brooklyn is an 81-one-square-mile peninsula that also borders New York Harbor and the Atlantic Ocean. In 1834, Brooklyn became a city in its own right and in the second half of the 19th century, a major center of industry. Its green coastline sprouted tall ships, towering grain terminals, glass and porcelain factories, and massive sugar and oil refineries&#x2014;some of the largest in the world. Thousands of immigrants&#x2014; including those from Ireland, Germany, Norway, Italy, Poland, and Russia&#x2014;poured into the city to work in the factories and refineries. Fueled by shipbuilding and industrial growth, Brooklyn became the nation's third most populous city by the time of the Civil War. It built civic and cultural showpieces, a stately city hall and art museum, and the 526-acre Prospect Park, which rivaled Manhattan's Central Park. But, Brooklyn's city status did not last the century. In 1898, despite fierce opposition from their political leaders, local residents voted by a slim margin to give up their independence and join the great consolidation of boroughs that formed New York City. The new borough maintained its own identity, however, its residents taking pride in calling themselves "Brooklynites," a special breed of New Yorkers. Descendants of 19th-century immigrants keep up the ethnic traditions that have characterized Brooklyn neighborhoods for generations. Brooklyn Then and Now illustrates this vibrant, ever changing borough's transformations.</p><p><b>Marcia Reiss</b>, the author of eight books about New York City history and architecture, has a long association with Brooklyn. She lived there, in Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope, for more than three decades and began writing about it in the 1970s as a reporter for the<i> Brooklyn Phoenix</i> newspaper. As a director for the New York City Department of Ports and Trade and later for the Parks Council, she worked on plans for converting Brooklyn&#x2019;s vacant industrial waterfront to public parks and ferry landings.

She now works on various children book projects as well as covers and editorial pieces for both children and adults.Hi there. My name is Ella Brook, and I live in a town called Cherrywood. I have blue eyes and dark brown hair. My best friends at school are Tom and Lenka. My worst enemy is Zoe. She lives next door and she&#x2019;s my Not-Best Friend. She looks mean even when she smiles. You&#x2019;ll meet them all later.<br> And this is my mom. She looks normal, like any other mom . . . but she&#x2019;s not.<br> Because she can turn into a fairy.<br> All she has to do is shut her eyes tight, say &#x201c;Marshmallow,&#x201d; . . . and POOF! She&#x2019;s Fairy Mom.<br> I love it when she&#x2019;s a fairy, because her wings shimmer like hundreds of rainbows. She wears a silver crown that shines like starlight. She can fly in the air and turn invisible and do all other kinds of real magic. Plus, she just bought a new wand that is really cool. It&#x2019;s called the Computawand V5. It has magic powers and a computer screen&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>an Extra-Fast Magic button.<br> Most fairies have Computawands nowa-days. They have Fairy Apps and Fairy Mail and even Fairy Games. Mom sometimes lets me look at the apps and games if I&#x2019;ve been good. (But she&nbsp;<i>always&nbsp;</i>turns off the magic function first.)<br> When Mom is not being a fairy, her Computawand just looks like a normal phone. Which is good, because it is a big secret that Mom is a fairy. No one must&nbsp;<i>ever&nbsp;</i>find out. I&#x2019;m not allowed to tell anyone, not even my friends.<br> Most of the time, Mom is a boss in an office. She is very good at it. She&#x2019;s also very good at telling bedtime stories and singing songs in the car. She&#x2019;s the best mom in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> Ollie is my little brother. He&#x2019;s only one year old and he can&#x2019;t turn into a fairy. Every- one says he looks like me, but he doesn&#x2019;t, be- cause he&#x2019;s a baby and I&#x2019;m not. He can&#x2019;t even speak properly. His favorite word is &#x201c;weezi-weezi-weezi.&#x201d;<br> And here&#x2019;s my dad. He can&#x2019;t turn into a fairy either and he can&#x2019;t do magic.&nbsp;He says he can park the car instead.<br>&nbsp; Mom knows I&#x2019;d like to be a fairy. She says that all the girls in my family turn into fairies when they&#x2019;re grown&nbsp;up, so one day I will too. I will have sparkly wings and my own Computawand. I can&#x2019;t&nbsp;<i>wait.</i><br> Aunty Jo and Granny look normal, just like Mom, but they can turn into fairies too. Aunty Jo has a Computawand V5 just like Mom&#x2019;s. She can work&nbsp;the computer screen very fast, and she knows every single spell code. Aunty Jo is very good at magic.<br> Granny won&#x2019;t get a Computawand because she doesn&#x2019;t like anything that goes&nbsp;<i>bleep.&nbsp;</i>She still has an old-fashioned fairy wand with a star on top. She says it&#x2019;s never let her down yet, and she won Best Spell at the Fairy Awards with it, three times in a row.<br> Aunty Jo won Best Spell last year too. In fact, Aunty Jo has won lots of fairy prizes.<br> Mom hasn&#x2019;t won any fairy prizes.<br> I&#x2019;m not allowed to start magic lessons yet, but I&#x2019;m trying to learn anyway. Every week, Mom has magic lessons from Fenella, her Fairy Teacher, who talks to her on Fairy Tube. I watch with her and try my hardest to remember all the spell codes.<br> Mom tries very hard too. I&#x2019;m sure she&#x2019;ll get better one day, but for now she&#x2019;s not very good at magic. You&#x2019;ll find out what I mean soon.<br> Here are some of the magic spells we have had fun with so far&#x2014;and some of the trouble they&#x2019;ve gotten us into!</p><h2>Emotional Beats: How to Easily Convert your Writing into Palpable Feelings (Author Tools)</h2><p>Because of the way our brains are wired, readers empathize more strongly if you don&#x2019;t name the emotion you are trying to describe. As soon as you name an emotion, readers go into thinking mode. And when they think about an emotion, they distance themselves from feeling it.A great way to show anger, fear, indifference, and the whole range of emotions that characterize the human experience, is through beats. These action snippets that pepper dialogue can help describe a wide range of emotions while avoiding lazy writing. The power of beats lies in their innate ability to create richer, more immediate, deeper writing.This book includes hundreds of examples that you can use for your inspiration, so that you, too, can harness this technique to easily convert your writing into palpable feelings. Perfect for genre fiction authors, use Emotional Beat as a feeling thesaurus and watch your writing take off!</p><p></p><h2>The Bill of Rights: A User&#39;s Guide</h2><p><b>With a foreword by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court.<br><br>An Engaging, Accessible Guide to the Bill of Rights for Everyday Citizens.</b><br><br>In <i>The Bill of Rights: A User's Guide</i>, award-winning author and constitutional scholar Linda R.

Things get weirder, though, when their house starts changing. Doors open and close by themselves; water boils on the unlit stove; and an unplugged air conditioner blasts cold air. Kasey is changing, too. Her blue eyes go green, she starts using old-fashioned language, and she forgets chunks of time. Most disturbing of all is the dangerous new chip on Kasey's shoulder. The formerly gentle child is gone, and the new Kasey is <em>angry</em>. Alexis is the only one who can stop her sister -- but what if that green-eyed girl isn't even Kasey anymore?<br></p><p><br><b>Katie Alender</b> (www.katiealender.com)<b> </b>is a graduate of the Florida State University Film School and lives in Los Angeles, where she works as a producer/writer. <i>Bad Girls Don't Die</i> is her first novel. <br>Grade 6&#x2013;9&#x2014;Although it begins like the average high school misfit story, Alender's novel quickly takes an unexpected turn. Alexis, a self-described anti-cheerleader, defiantly embraces her role as bad student and social outcast, skipping class and spending her time in the darkroom, until the increasingly odd behavior of her little sister, Kasey, draws her into a world of evil spirits and dangerous games. At first, inexplicable dreams and eerie balls of green light hovering around Alexis's house seem like fringe occurrences in a story otherwise concerned with family, friendship, and a tentative romance. But soon, bizarre happenings take over, and Alexis comes to realize that Kasey is demon-possessed and hell-bent on murder. It's difficult to reconcile a teen coming-of-age story with a ghost-populated murder mystery, and Alender succeeds somewhat awkwardly. However, Alexis's story is compelling, and her voice is funny and authentic despite the creepy situations in which she finds herself. A good additional purchase for girls who like to be scared a little&#x2014;but not too much.&#x2014;<i>Emma Burkhart, Springside School, Philadelphia, PA</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

I was in terrible shape. I could barely get out of bed. I missed work. I was in shock at first. I kept thinking that it was a huge mistake, and he would come to his senses and come back to me. When he didn&#x2019;t, I was completely devastated. I didn&#x2019;t know if I was coming or going. I was an absolute wreck. It was an awful moment in time, but it&#x2019;s way behind me now.&#x201d;--Gia<br>A Window into Your Soul--Assessing the Damage<br><br>The breaking apart of a romantic relationship is an extraordinarily painful event, whether you&#x2019;ve been dating for a year or married for thirty. Even if you initiated your split, you are going to be overcome with interminable sorrow. You are not only mourning the loss of someone significant in your life, but saying farewell to your dreams of an eternity together.<br><br>The first weeks and months tend to be the most treacherous in the road to recovery. Pervasive grief invades your existence. You question everything, including your self-worth, your choices, your career, your friendships--everything. Numerous thoughts, feelings, and emotions run through your brain. The majority of the women I interviewed had at least half of the following experiences:<br>* You&#x2019;re in shock--unable to comprehend why your relationship ended, or feeling as if it can&#x2019;t be happening to you. You feel devoid of feelings, numb and detached.<br><br>* You wonder if you can ever trust again, if the pain will ever subside, and if you will ever feel joy or happiness again.<br><br>* Depression and despondency permeate your body and soul. You feel hopeless, helpless, unable to cope. Your self-esteem is shot. You have lost your ability to concentrate and feel ill equipped to make decisions.<br><br>* You have anxiety and anxiety attacks as early stage symptoms. You feel paralyzed with fear and dread, unable to sit still. You tremble and shake, have heart palpitations and trouble breathing.<br><br>* You understand intellectually that your relationship is over, but you cannot accept it emotionally. Some days you are convinced you can salvage it, or that in time your partner will return.<br><br>* You are unable to control your emotions. You can&#x2019;t contain yourself. You cry or rant constantly and call friends obsessively.<br><br>* You feel embarrassed that your relationship ended. You&#x2019;re ashamed to tell anyone and you feel humiliated.<br><br>* You contact your ex repetitively via phone, e-mails, texts, or Facebook. Or you may find yourself glued to your telephone, waiting for it to ring.<br><br>* If you are ending a marriage, you have the lengthy process of divorce to consider. You feel incredibly overwhelmed thinking about what you&#x2019;ll do and how to divide the life you and your ex have accrued.<br><br>* You are obsessed about your breakup. These thoughts intrude most of your day, and you dream about your ex at night. You re-create and dissect the last moments, weeks, and months, again and again. The final conversation loops through your brain repetitively.<br><br>* If you have children, you worry about how they will handle the separation and feel guilt ridden that you have imposed psychological damage on them. You feel too inundated to deal with parenting.<br><br>* You are filled with self-blame, self-loathing, doubt, and regret. You&#x2019;re convinced that you blew it. You think, &#x201c;If I were only a better partner. If I were more loving, giving, attentive. If I only did this better. If only . . . &#x201d;<br><br>* You are filled with rage. You have huge, uncontrollable outbursts of anger.<br><br>* If your ex supported you, or carried part of your financial load, you are frightened about finances.<br><br>* If your relationship ended over your partner&#x2019;s affair, your healing is even more complicated. You feel completely betrayed, blindsided, shaken, and shocked. Your sense of justice, order, and good in the world has evaporated.<br><br>* You think that your final ship has sailed. Time is running out. You wonder if you&#x2019;ll ever meet someone again, if you&#x2019;ll be able to bear children.<br><br>* You have trouble eating and sleeping. Weight loss and insomnia are quite common after a breakup. Or you eat too much and sleep excessively.<br><br>* You feel unlucky, victimized, as if nothing ever works out quite right for you. You&#x2019;re steeped in self-pity.<br><br>* You feel completely overwhelmed and &#x201c;out of sorts.&#x201d; Food shopping, caring for your home, and washing your clothes seem like insurmountable tasks. Or, perhaps you have unending, manic energy. You&#x2019;ve refolded every item in your closet and can&#x2019;t stop cleaning.<br><br>* You may be filling up every single waking moment with plans, or sitting at home, completely isolated.<br>The Importance of Validating Your Feelings<br><br>Perhaps you recognize yourself in some of these statements. Or possibly you have experienced them all. Every single declaration represents the normal range of emotions that we experience after a separation. The first step that you must do on the road to recovery is to validate each emotion you are feeling as natural.<br><br>Let me take this opportunity to offer you my sincerest condolences over the sorrow that has befallen you. Breaking up is so incredibly difficult. What could possibly prepare you for this monumental heartache? I know it can feel all encompassing and very scary. I&#x2019;ve been there, and so have millions of others.<br><br>You are now officially submerged in the early stages of breakup grief. Life has become a daily barrage of emotionally charged thoughts and feelings--uncharted territory for most. Many discuss feeling absolutely insane as they observe their moods swinging wildly back and forth like an out-of-whack pendulum. You are entering a whole new and frightening world. You are feeling and thinking things that are quite foreign to you.<br><br>It&#x2019;s very important to take the time to validate your feelings. It will allow you to see that you are right where you should be, which will help to ease the anguish you are experiencing.<br><br>Unfortunately, the validation you crave rarely comes from your ex, which can be extremely upsetting. We go through all sorts of machinations to try to get our partners to take responsibility, yet only a few do. And often friends and family members, although well meaning, cannot fully understand the gravity of your situation, which can be equally frustrating. The absence of having your experience acknowledged can make you feel even more alone. If you haven&#x2019;t found a way to validate yourself, it&#x2019;s important that you do so right now using this book and my words to enhance your healing. Please remember, you are allowed to feel what you feel. This is your essential right. It is OK that you feel miserable and it is absolutely necessary that you accept your grief. Validating yourself and feeling your feelings is a vital part of the healing process.<br>Taking Time to Grieve: Making Peace with Your Discomfort<br><br>&#x201c;The first few months after my marriage ended were just horrific. I was extremely devastated yet kind of numb. After that, the tears came. Rivers upon rivers of tears. Sadness of such depth, like I&#x2019;d never experienced before. I hated the way I felt and went through all sorts of motions to try to escape. I finally realized that I needed to stop running and find a safe place to work with my emotions. Finding that place helped me survive.&#x201d;--Helene<br><br>&#x201c;Immediately after my breakup I scheduled myself 24/7. I ran myself ragged trying to avoid my pain. That was a mistake and made me feel pretty depleted. Finally I slowed down, and that&#x2019;s when I started feeling better. I realized I needed time to grieve, time to clarify my situation. You must leave time for reflection--it&#x2019;s extremely important and very worthwhile.&#x201d;--Abby<br>In order to survive the early stages after a breakup, you have to make peace with your sorrow, and accept the realization that it&#x2019;s going to stick around for a while. I understand that the idea of patience and gradual healing is counterintuitive to most. Unless you are a naturally patient person (and most of us, including me, are not), practicing the art of tolerance is no easy feat. Our natural inclination toward suffering is to press the fast-forward button and get out of the experience as quickly as possible. But bucking up against how you are feeling right now will accomplish little. In fact it can backfire and make you feel even worse than you already do. It is important to try to master patience, and to realize that there are many valuable lessons for you to learn at this juncture. Your journey will be much more comfortable if you reconcile the fact that healing takes time and there are no shortcuts.<br><br>Often women in the early stages after a breakup or divorce say, &#x201c;When will I feel better?&#x201d; &#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t I feeling better?&#x201d; &#x201c;I hate feeling this way!&#x201d;<br><br>These statements are completely valid. Does anyone ever enjoy suffering? Of course not. It&#x2019;s extremely uncomfortable. It is a good thing to eliminate unnecessary suffering, but breakup suffering is necessary--it&#x2019;s an important step on the road toward healing, understanding, and transformation.<br><br>Consider a spiritual response to suffering. According to the ancient Buddhist teachings, the way to end suffering is to follow a gradual path of self-improvement and enlightenment. Suffering will disappear when progress is made on the path. I think this philosophical approach makes a great deal of sense, and in time, you will too.<br><br>Although the heartache can feel insurmountable, I promise you that if you do the work to process the ending of your relationship correctly, over time, you will recover fully. Together we will navigate this rocky terrain and find healthy outlets for your pain. We will clarify your emotions, figure out why your relationship ended, gather useful tools, and crawl out of the hole. Although it may sound inconceivable today, it is highly probable that you will become your best possible self, healthier and happier than you could ever imagine.<br>Taking Care of Yourself<br><br>Most of us are not comfortable with the notion of taking care of ourselves. Women are hardwired to care for others before thinking of ourselves. Recently I attended a dear friend&#x2019;s milestone birthday celebration, which was for women only. During dinner the conversation turned to summer plans, and one woman announced that she was visiting a spa with her family. I commented that I thought it was a lovely idea and perhaps I would visit a spa in the future--on my own. A woman sitting next to me, whom I barely knew, replied, &#x201c;Oh, you&#x2019;ll never go!&#x201d; Her comment intrigued me. She didn&#x2019;t know me, yet she was predicting that I wouldn&#x2019;t do what I just said I would. &#x201c;Why would you say that?&#x201d; I inquired. &#x201c;Because you&#x2019;re a woman. You put your family first, you put your job first, you put everything ahead of taking care of yourself. This is what I do too. This is what we all do!&#x201d;<br><br>Her words startled me, yet they were true. We are caregivers as opposed to caretakers, and there is a greater percentage of women than men in our country caring for children, spouses, and parents. We are programmed to go, go, go--putting the needs of our family, friends, and lovers way ahead of our own. In fact, many of us measure our self-worth by this selfless behavior.<br><br>I&#x2019;m asking you to break the mold and find a way to put yourself first. To take care of yourself. To take your own nurturing seriously, even though it may initially feel very strange. Mark it off on your calendar and pick a time for a daily meeting with yourself--a daily comfort session. This is a gift to yourself that you deserve.<br>Creating a Comfort Zone<br><br>&#x201c;After my divorce when I was very down, a friend suggested I find a photograph of myself at the happiest moment of my life, frame it, and put it someplace where I&#x2019;d see it every day. My husband had just moved out and I decided to fix up my bedroom to be a sort of shrine to myself. I looked at this photo daily and remembered who I was when I was a happy person. Remind yourself that you can be that person again--you will be that person again. This worked for me and it can work for you.&#x201d;--Roberta<br><br>&#x201c;The concept of taking care of myself was very new to me. I had to remind myself each day that it was my mission to allow myself to grieve. I turned my bedroom into a sanctuary. I immediately bought new bedding as a symbolic act--out with the old, in with the new. I didn&#x2019;t want any reminders of my ex. I used that room to relax, stay calm, sort through my feelings, and journal. I created a comfortable place where I could feel secure.&#x201d;--Sabrina<br>What I&#x2019;d like you to do now is create &#x201c;a room of your own.&#x201d; This room will be a safety zone while you pass through this complicated yet necessary stage in the healing process. Trust me, it will be incredibly beneficial to you: a secure place, complete with your imprint, where you can go to grieve on your own terms. Perhaps there is a place in your home--even a quiet corner of a room will do--that you can designate as your special place to experience comfort while mourning your loss. It doesn&#x2019;t matter which room you choose, but it must be someplace where you can create a sense of peace, harmony, and security.<br><br>I suggest using your bedroom, as I do when I need a serene place to escape to. Here are some ideas on how to create a calming atmosphere:<br>* Burn aromatic candles or incense.<br><br>* Use good mood lighting.<br><br>* Get some stunning accent pillows.<br><br>* Purchase some new bedding (especially if your ex slept in your bed). Many women I spoke with describe this as a must-do!<br><br>* Play soft and soothing music.<br><br>* Buy a white noise machine to mask unwanted sounds.<br><br>* Add some beautiful flowers or plants.<br><br>* Give the room a mini makeover--relocate furniture, repaint the walls, and consider new window treatments, paintings, photographs, or posters.<br>Once you have this room set up, find some time each day to spend there, basking in this newly created comfort. Many women report that while in their special place they take time to journal, read spiritual or motivational books, meditate, or watch movies. You can also do any hobbies you enjoy in this sanctuary.</p><h2>At the Altar of Sexual Idolatry Workbook</h2><p>For nearly 30 years, Steve Gallagher has been living with and ministering to men in sexual sin at Pure Life Ministries.

For three men in particular, 1998 would become a grueling battle for a new North American birding record. Bouncing from coast to coast on frenetic pilgrimages for once-in-a-lifetime rarities, they brave broiling deserts, bug-infested swamps, and some of the lumpiest motel mattresses known to man. This unprecedented year of beat-the-clock adventures ultimately leads one man to a record so gigantic that it is unlikely ever to be bested. Here, prizewinning journalist Mark Obmascik creates a dazzling, fun narrative of the 275,000-mile odyssey of these three obsessives as they fight to win the greatest&#x2014; or maybe worst&#x2014;birding contest of all time.</p><p>A classic in the making -- an account of the biggest year in birdwatching history.<br><br>In the USA, some 50 million people lay claim to being bird-watchers or ?birders,? spending billions of dollars on birding-related travel and membership fees every year. A select, and utterly obsessed, few compete in one of the world?s quirkiest contests -- the race to spot the most species in North America in a single year. And 1998 wasn?t just a big year. It was the biggest. <b>The Big Year </b>is Pulitzer Prize-winner Mark Obmascik?s account of what was to become the greatest birding year of all time.<br><br>It was freak weather conditions that ensured all previous records were broken, but what becomes clear within the pages of this classic portrait of obsession is that while our feathered friends may be the objective of the Big Year competition, it?s the curious activities and behavioural patterns of the pursuing ?homo sapiens? that are the real cause for concern. It is a contest that reveals much of the human character in extremes. Such are the author?s powers of observation that he brilliantly brings to life and gets under the skin of these extraordinary, eccentric and obsessive birders while empathizing with and eventually succumbing to the all-consuming nature of their obsession. The result is a wonderfully funny, acutely observed classic to rank alongside the best of Bill Bryson.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i>Mark Obmascik&nbsp;is a Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning journalist and bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Big Year</i>, which was made into a movie, and&nbsp;<i>Halfway to Heaven</i>.

It was late summer 2009. &#x201c;The arthritis in my knees was getting so bad my doctor was ready to put me on constant pain meds,&#x201d; she told me recently. &#x201c;I told him I&#x2019;d think about it and get back to him.&#x201d; Thinking about it meant research. Research convinced her that it was time to take action. Specifically, to strengthen her muscles with a serious training program. That led her to <i>The New Rules of Lifting for Women</i>, a book my coauthors and I had published the year before. We wrote it for a simple reason: Readers asked us for it. They asked because the guidance women received from the media, from their peers, and even from fitness professionals in health clubs was the opposite of what we provided for men.<br> &nbsp;<br> This was despite the fact there was no reason to give different advice to men and women. Exercise science had concluded long before that the muscles of men and women are exactly the same. Your muscles and my muscles perform the same actions and produce the same movements. Pound for pound, they generate the same amount of force. When trained, they respond equally well. But here&#x2019;s the worst part: This wasn&#x2019;t secret information. Everyone who wrote about strength training or trained female athletes or worked with female clients either knew or should have known.<br> &nbsp;<br> The exercises in <i>NROL for Women </i>weren&#x2019;t the ones readers like Dana were used to seeing in books and magazines. She&#x2019;d never done a push-up before, or a deadlift, or a squat with a barbell on her back. And the advice to focus on strength and muscle development, rather than &#x201c;toning&#x201d; and &#x201c;shaping,&#x201d; was a paradigm shift for women who&#x2019;d developed an irrational fear of &#x201c;bulking up&#x201d; if they lifted anything bigger than their forearms or heavier than a purse. <br> &nbsp;<br> So on September 9, 2009, Dana tried it. Arthritic joints and all. She could barely bend her knees on the squat and had to do her push-ups against a kitchen counter. But by the end of the program, she could do eight push-ups. <i>Traditional </i>push-ups, with her hands and toes on the floor. She could lift a 135-pound barbell off the ground and squat with 100 pounds on her back. And those pain meds her doctor was about to prescribe? Turns out, she didn&#x2019;t need them. She just needed to get strong.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Anyone who actually finishes the program comes out a changed person,&#x201d; she told me. &#x201c;Most of us never knew how strong we could be. It opened doors we didn&#x2019;t even know were there.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> OUR GREATEST MISTAKE<br> &nbsp;<br> Here&#x2019;s the irony of Dana&#x2019;s transformation: We never thought readers like her would pick up the book. The original title, <i>Lift Like a Man, Look Like a Goddess</i>, signaled our goal of reaching women who were already working out but not getting the results they wanted. I saw countless women like that in the gym. They were healthy and appeared able and willing to work hard toward their goals, but did so with workouts that were unlikely to help them accomplish anything useful. Those are the readers who contacted Alwyn and me when we published <i>The New Rules of Lifting</i>, our first book together, in 2006.<br> &nbsp;<br> To our delight, <i>NROL for Women </i>(the title we very wisely switched to after the book was already written and photographed) reached that target audience. We heard from readers who&#x2019;d lost fat, improved their physiques in noticeable ways, and found they enjoyed doing the type of workouts we provided for guys in the original <i>NROL</i>.<br><br> But we also heard from readers like Dana, who was so excited by her progress that she started a Facebook group for her fellow lifters. Beyond their gender and the fact that they love lifting heavy things, they have little in common. In fact, these days I rarely hear from anyone who fits my original concept. Our universe of lifters includes women from their twenties to their seventies. From competitive athletes to complete beginners. From underweight to severely obese. From healthy to anything but.</p><h2>Plus-Sized Elf Vol. 1</h2><p><p><b>A WELL-ROUNDED DIET...?!</b></p><p>Massage therapist Naoe gets an unusual visitor to the Smiley Boar clinic: Elfuda, a beautiful elf from another world who&#x2019;s addicted to junk food!

Drawing from her career as a successful TV pilot writer, Miller shares her hard-earned knowledge about creating TV series that sell to Hollywood. She covers essential elements such as character, world of the show, story engine, tone, and themes for dramas and sitcoms. In this book, Miller introduces the groundbreaking character-driven structure that will help you solve even the most difficult script problems and create structurally sound, emotionally satisfying stories. Miller illustrates the practical application of her character-driven script structure in current successful TV shows, including Cinemax's The Knick, NBC's Hannibal, Amazon's Transparent, BBC America's Orphan Black, ABC's Modern Family, FOX's Empire, FXX's It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, AMC's The Walking Dead, FOX's Brooklyn Nine-Nine, ABC's How To Get Away With Murder, Starz's Outlander, CBS's The Good Wife, Showtime's Episodes, and many others. The Hero Succeeds shares professional screenwriting expertise, tools, and techniques previously available only to Miller's students at USC's School of Cinematic Arts and Boston University's Film &amp; Television program. Whether you write drama or comedy for broadcast, cable, or digital distribution, The Hero Succeeds is the guide you need to build or expand your TV career.</p><p>The first time I developed a show with Kam Miller, I was stunned by her insight into character, form, and story. She had all the elements down perfectly. Then we pitched it--she is indeed the best pitcher I have ever worked with, bar none. Kam's expertise is reflected in her book. "The Hero Succeeds" is the absolute best bible for anyone who wants to succeed in the TV series business! <br><strong>Jeffrey Kramer <br>Executive Producer <br>CBS Television Studios</strong><br><br>As a development executive, I've heard more than 3,000 pitches and developed hundreds of TV pilot scripts. Kam Miller's "The Hero Succeeds" delivers everything it takes to write a killer pilot script. It's knowledge that only someone who's been doing it successfully for years can provide. "The Hero Succeeds" is modern, relevant, and entertaining. I recommend Kam's book to every new--and experienced--writer I work with. "The Hero Succeeds" is a must-read for anyone who aspires to write a professional-level TV pilot that can sell.<br><strong>Carole Kirschner<br>WGA Showrunner Training Program Director<br>CBS Diversity Writers Mentoring Program Director<br>Entertainment Career Consultant</strong><br><br>"The Hero Succeeds" is fantastic!

She has an original and thought-provoking voice when it comes to writing the character-driven pilot. Kam has created a unique story system that will help you elevate your game and find success.

You'll notice her clever use of both female and male pronouns throughout implying that heroes come in all shapes and sizes.

Wright, you ve missed out on a classic Christmas story that will change how you view the season of giving. Its sequel, aptly titled Christmas Jars Reunion is reminiscent of the first.&nbsp; Yet, this story stands on its own, bringing the reader once again into Hope s Jensen s remarkable life. The author includes a quote from a Christmas Jar recipient at the beginning of each chapter. But even Hope Jensen needs to learn what the spirit of selfless giving is truly about. When Clark Maxwell re-enters her life, she must decide if she can allow him into her heart once again, and discover that loving someone might just be worth the risk. Hope sets the lofty goal of distributing 1,001 Christmas Jars in honor of Chuck, deceased owner of Chuck s diner. But in the process, the importance of the original Christmas Jar is lost. It will take a stranger, a young girl, and an interview of a lifetime to bring back the true meaning that the Christmas Jar was intended for. Christmas Jars Reunion is a story that will inspire you to look closer at your life and remind you of the significance of selfless giving. --By Heather, October 09, 2009</p><h2>Blow Fly: Scarpetta (Book 12)</h2><p><b>A cold case turns red-hot when a death-row inmate renews his acquaintance with Dr. Kay Scarpetta in this &#x201c;utterly chilling&#x201d; (<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>)&nbsp;#1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.</b><br><br>Settling into her new life as a private forensic consultant, Kay Scarpetta agrees to investigate a cold case in Louisiana&#x2014;the baffling eight-year-old murder of a woman with a history of blackouts and violent outbursts.

Kate Reading's low, comfortable voice and good impersonations are a perfect fit for Cornwell's wild plot twists and calculating psychopaths. Reading convincingly renders each of the characters, male and female, sane and insane, with an appropriate frisson of fear.

During this time, he was inspired by the island s rich and diverse culture. Soon after moving to the United States, Mr. Bootman embraced art as a measure of escape from the pressures of adjusting to a new environment at an early age. Mr. Bootman cites finding his first comic book as the life-changing experience that marked the beginning of his career as an artist. <p>Mr. Bootman began formal training at LaGuardia High School of the Arts, which served to deepen his appreciation for other disciplines, and solidified his own passion for the visual arts. In college, Mr. Bootman studied photography, writing, and illustration, honing his skills under the tutelage of professional artists. Mr. Bootman was encouraged to pursue children s book art, as it allowed him the freedom to express himself through various media. Ultimately, the instructors at the School of Visual Arts prepared Mr. Bootman for the challenges of working as a professional illustrator. </p><p>Mr. Bootman s first book, "Young Frederick Douglass", was published in 1994 and received starred reviews. He has since illustrated many children s books, textbooks, periodicals, and book covers. Mr. Bootman has worked with several publishers including Random House ("Follow the Leader"), Harper Collins ("In My Momma s Kitchen"), Scholastic ("Oh, No, Toto!"), and Holiday House ("Papa s Mark"). Mr. Bootman is the recipient of the Coretta Scott King Honor 2004, the Schneider Family Book Award 2006, the Ashley Bryan Lifetime Achievement Honor 2006, and several others. His books have won such awards as The Teachers Choice Award, The Comstock Award, The Storytelling World Award, The Golden Kite Honor, and many others. Mr. Bootman s first written and Illustrated book ("Fish For The Grand Lady"), debuted in the fall of 2006. In addition to illustrating Mr. Bootman enjoys teaching and presenting to students throughout the country. </p><p>Mr. Bootman credits the lively rhythms and vibrant palette of Trinidad with leaving an indelible mark on his creative expression. He continues to grow as an artist as he welcomes the challenges that each new project invites. As Mr. Bootman s work serves to inspire both early readers and future artists alike, he hopes to encourage young minds to embrace and follow their passions. <br></p>Vivien Thomas (1910 1985) combined imagination, skilled dexterity, and hard-won medical knowledge to develop tools and techniques for successful open heart surgery on babies. His life and work are vivid in the pages of this picture book biography, in which Hooks details how his youthful work in fine carpentry, paired with his desire to become a doctor, propelled Thomas in his pursuit of his goals. In addition to the challenges facing any medical researcher, Thomas also endured such obstacles as the economic devastation of the Great Depression, unequal treatment as a black research assistant, the challenge of finding housing in the Jim Crow South, and the failure to be recognized for his monumental contributions to the field of neonatal heart surgery. It is the work Thomas achieved, however, in spite of these enormous challenges, that will pique reader interest as they learn about his design of tiny operating tools and his role guiding surgeons through neonatal operations. Bootman s lifelike watercolor illustrations beautifully and vividly evoke the carpentry shop, research labs, and auditorium where, years later, Thomas was finally honored for his work and appointed to the faculty at Johns Hopkins. Beyond the crucial message of perseverance and spotlight on prejudiced attitudes that still resonate today, this middle-grade picture book illuminates the life of little-known man whose innovations continue to be essential to modern medicine. --<i>Booklist</i>, <b>starred review</b><br><br>Tiny Stitches Review By Kirkus Reviews Hooks (The Noisy Night, 2014, etc.) and Bootman (Hey, Charleston!, 2013, etc.) illuminate the trials and triumphs of Vivien Thomas and his vital role in the development of children's open-heart surgery. Unable to attend medical school due to the Great Depression, Vivien (as Hooks styles him) takes a job as a research assistant at Vanderbilt University under Dr. Alfred Blalock, who is so impressed with Vivien's surgical skill that he insists Vivien accompany him when he accepts a new position at Johns Hopkins in 1941. Despite the constant prejudice of the segregated hospital, Vivien researches and designs an operation to correct the fatal child heart defect known as "blue babies" syndrome an operation that would come to save thousands of children's lives and for which Vivien himself can only serve as a coach because only white staff may perform surgery. After more than 26 years without public recognition for his revolutionary contributions, Vivien receives an honorary doctorate in 1976, realizing his dream at last. Told candidly with a touch of gravitas, Vivien's story deftly presents complex social and medical issues along with the gently insistent message of perseverance. Bootman's full-page watercolors and muted palette gracefully bring emotional life to Vivien's personal and clinical scenes alike never has hospital green been so poignant. A good alternative to dense, chapter biographies and a rousing tribute to a man unjustly forgotten. (notes, glossary, references) --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>Vivien Thomas had long strived to become a doctor, but after losing his college savings in the stock market crash of 1929, he instead took a job as a research technician at Vanderbilt University. As an African-American, Thomas s title was officially janitor. Despite persistent racial prejudice, Thomas devised a means to perform open-heart surgery on blue babies who were not getting enough oxygen, a procedure that would save the lives of many infants. Hooks writes with vivid detail and immediacy, describing Thomas s anxiety as he coaches Dr. Blalock, the doctor who originally hired him, on performing the first surgery. Bootman s subdued watercolors channel the sobering climate of Depression-era America in a sensitive portrayal of a little-recognized medical pioneer. --<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Sons of Vikings: A Legendary History of the Viking Age</h2><p>Sons of Vikings tells the story of the Viking Age (793-1066 A.D.) through the lives of extraordinary people.

This brilliantly illustrated volume takes the reader through Tutankhamun&#x2019;s tomb room-by-room in the order that it was discovered and excavated by Howard Carter, illuminating the tomb&#x2019;s most magnificent artifacts and objects.</p><p>Leading authority Dr. Zahi Hawass imbues the text with his own inimitable flavor, imagining how the uncovering and opening of the tomb must have felt for Carter, while Sandro Vannini&#x2019;s extraordinary photographs reproduce the objects in infinitesimal detail. Now available in a compact edition, and published to coincide with a global touring exhibition that begins in Los Angeles in March 2018 and ends at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 2023, this sumptuous volume is the definitive record of Tutankhamun&#x2019;s legacy.</p> 324 illustrations</p><p><p><strong>Zahi Hawass</strong> has been secretary general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, Egypt, and director of excavations at Giza, Saqqara, and the Bahariya Oasis. Over his career he has made many major archaeological discoveries, of which the most spectacular are the tombs of the pyramid builders at Giza, the Valley of the Golden Mummies, and the identification of the mummy of Queen Hatshepsut.</p><p><strong>Sandro Vannini</strong> is an acclaimed Italian photographer who has worked closely with Zahi Hawass over the years.</p>The enthusiasm of archaeologist and prolific author Hawass radiates from this book. Hawass is the secretary-general of the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Egypt, and he discovered the tombs of the pyramid builders at Giza and identified the mummy of pharaoh Hatshepsut. His presentation of objects in this book follows the path of the tomb chambers in their order of excavation by Howard Carter. Hawass tells the story of the tomb's discovery as seen through the eyes of Carter and of the Egyptians who worked with him. Many of the 26 foldouts show top/bottom, front/back, and side images of objects pictured elsewhere from only one viewpoint. Although lavishly illustrated (featuring 324 color illustrations) with photographs by Vannini, who has contributed to many other archaeological volumes, this is no mere coffee-table book. Not to be outshone by the magnificent images, Hawass's text provides a history of the process of Carter's discovery.

The stated purpose of the Act was to create a stable monetary system to bring financial stability to the United States and prevent such economic crises as the Panic of 1907 from occurring again. Sixteen years after the passage of the Act, under the Federal Reserve's watch, the nation experienced the worst financial collapse in our history and descended into our deepest and darkest depression--the Great Depression--a crisis far worse than the Panic of 1907 by orders of magnitude. <br><br> Since the creation of the Fed, we have lurched from boom to bust time and again as financial crisis has followed financial crisis. By any objective measure, the Fed has failed to achieve the stated objectives of its founding. Today, our economic imbalances are extreme and compounding and approaching a day of reckoning. Another financial collapse looms and casts a dark shadow over our future. Under the stewardship of the Federal Reserve, further hardship for our struggling middle class is certain and inevitable. <br><br> It doesn't have to be this way. <br><br> Drawing heavily from the writings and ideas of Benjamin Franklin, Alfred Owen Crozier and Carroll Quigley, "The Tyranny of the Federal Reserve" looks back on how we got here and forward to a brighter future through monetary reform.</p><p></p><h2>A 10-Week Journey to Becoming a Vessel God Can Use</h2><p>The author&#39;s transparent, vulnerable message impacts women in a profound way, showing them that God loves them, imperfect as they are.

The behavior of individuals with Narcissistic Personality Disorder generally defies logic but sadly, their tactics in the Family Court System often fool Judges, Commissioners, Attorneys, Minor&#x2019;s Counsel, Social Workers, Therapists and even trained Evaluators. Narcissists are the masters of manipulation and projection and are known to launch stealth assaults that will leave their victims in an utter state of confusion and desperation. Victims are often left shattered and without a voice because they feel that no one could possibly believe or understand what they are silently enduring. Author, Tina Swithin, understands what it&#x2019;s like to divorce a narcissist. Tina spent over four years on the battlefield of the Family Court System while acting as her own attorney in a desperate attempt to protect her two young daughters.

Rooting his argument in common sense and everyday reality, he demonstrates that a common good constitutes the very essence of any society or nation. Societies, he says, undergo virtuous cycles that reinforce the common good as well as vicious cycles that undermine it, one of which America has been experiencing for the past five decades. This process can and must be reversed. But first we need to weigh the moral obligations of citizenship and carefully consider how we relate to honor, shame, patriotism, truth, and the meaning of leadership.<br><br> Powerful, urgent, and utterly vital, this is a heartfelt missive from one of our foremost political thinkers.</p><p>ROBERT B. REICH is Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley. He has served in three national administrations and has written fifteen books, including <i>The Work of Nations</i>, <i>Saving Capitalism</i>, <i>Supercapitalism</i>, and <i>Locked in the Cabinet</i>. His articles have appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>The Atlantic</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Washington Post</i>, and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. He is co-creator of the award-winning documentary <i>Inequality for All</i> and of the Netflix documentary <i>Saving Capitalism</i>, and is co-founder of Inequality Media. He lives in Berkeley and blogs at robertreich.org.Introduction I was at the impressionable age of fourteen when I heard John F. Kennedy urge us not to ask what America can do for us but what we can do for America. Seven years later I took a job as a summer intern in the Senate office of his brother Robert F. Kennedy. It was not a glamorous job, to say the least. I felt lucky when I was asked to run his signature machine. But I told myself that in a very tiny way I was doing something for the good of the country. That was a half century ago. I wish I could say America is a better place now than it was then. Surely our lives are more convenient. Fifty years ago there were no cash machines or smartphones, and I wrote my first book on a typewriter. As individuals, we are as kind and generous as ever. We volunteer in our communities, donate, and help one another. We pitch in during natural disasters and emergencies. We come to the aid of individuals in need. We are a more inclusive society, in that African Americans, women, and gays have legal rights they didn&#x2019;t have a half century ago. Yet our civic life&#x2014;as citizens in our democï¿½racy, participants in our economy, managers or employees of companies, and members or leaders of organizations&#x2014;seems to have sharply deteriorated. What we have lost, I think, is a sense of our connectedness to each other and to our ideals&#x2014;the America that John F. Kennedy asked that we contribute to.<br><br> Starting in the late 1970s, Americans began talkï¿½ing less about the common good and more about self-aggrandizement. The shift is the hallmark of our era: from the &#x201c;Greatest Generation&#x201d; to the &#x201c;Me Generation,&#x201d; from &#x201c;we&#x2019;re all in it together&#x201d; to &#x201c;you&#x2019;re on your own.&#x201d; In 1977, motivational speaker Robert Ringer wrote a book that reached the top of the <i>New York Times </i>best-seller list entiï¿½tled <i>Looking Out for # 1. </i>It extolled the virtues of selfishness to a wide and enthusiastic audience. The 1987 film <i>Wall Street </i>epitomized the new ethos in the character Gordon Gekko and his signature line, &#x201c;Greed, for lack of a better word, is good.&#x201d;<br><br> The past five decades have also been marked by growing cynicism and distrust toward all of the basic institutions of American society&#x2014;government, the media, corporaï¿½tions, big banks, police, universities, charities, religious institutions, the professions. There is a wide and pervasive sense that the system as a whole is no longer working as it should. A growing number of Americans feel neglected and powerless. Some are poor, or black or Latino; others are white and have been on a downward economic escaï¿½lator for years. Many in the middle also feel stressed and voiceless. Whether we call ourselves Democrats or Repubï¿½licans, liberals or conservatives, we share many of the same anxieties and feel much of the same distrust. We have nonetheless been cleaved into warring ideological tribes, and tribes within those tribes. Some of us have even been seduced by demagogues and conspiracy theorists. We seem to be a long way from when John F. Kennedy asked that Americans contribute to the well-being of all. We no longer even discuss what we owe one another as members of the same society.<br><br> As I write this, I am now a septuagenarian and Donald Trump is president. In many ways Trump epitomizes what has gone wrong. But as I hope to make clear, Trump is not the cause. He is a consequence&#x2014;the logical outcome of what has unfolded over many years. His election was itself propelled by widespread anxieties, and distrust toward our political and economic system. Say what you want about him, Trump has at least brought us back to first principles. Some presidents, like Ronald Reagan, got us talking about the size and role of government. Trump has got us talking about democracy versus tyranny. Some presidents, like Bill Clinton, invited a discussion of how we can make the most of ourselves. Trump, by dint of his pugnacious character and the divisiveness he has fueled, raises the question of what connects us, of what we hold in common.<br> Hence, this book.<br><br> Is there a common good that still binds us together as Americans? That it&#x2019;s even necessary to ask shows how far we&#x2019;ve strayed. Today, some think we&#x2019;re connected by the whiteness of our skin, or our adherence to Christianity, or the fact that we were born in the United States. I believe we&#x2019;re bound together by the ideals and principles we share, and the mutual obligations those principles entail.<br><br> My hope is that this book provokes a discussion of the good we have had in common, what has happened to it, and what we might do to restore it. Perhaps this book can even provide a means for people with opposing views to debate these questions civilly. My goal is not that we all agree on the common good. It is that we get into the habit and practice of thinking and talking about it, and hearï¿½ing one another&#x2019;s views about it. This alone would be an advance.<br><br> I should clarify from the start what this book is not. It is not about communism or socialism, although in this fractious era I wouldn&#x2019;t be surprised if the word &#x201c;common&#x201d; in the title causes some people to assume it is. It is not a book about what progressives or Democrats or Repubï¿½licans ought to do to win elections, what messages they should convey, or policies they should propose. There is already quite enough advice to go around. And it&#x2019;s not a book about Donald Trump, although he does come up from time to time.<br><br> It is a book about what we owe one another as memï¿½bers of the same society&#x2014;or at least what we did owe one another more than a half century ago when I heard John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s challenge. It is about the good we once had in common&#x2014;and, if we are to get back to being a far better functioning society, must have again.</p><h2>Every Day: A Five-Year Memory Book</h2><p><p><b><strong><em>Every Day - A Five-Year Memory Book</em></strong></b></p><p><strong>Treasure your thoughts and memories with this 5-year journal:</strong> Your classic 5-year memory book is the perfect way to track the ups and downs and progress of your life, day-by-day, during 5 years.</p><p><strong>More than just a daily diary - it's a 5-year diary:</strong> Your daily dairy entries for each day of the year are recorded five times on each page - one journal entry for each of 5 years on a given date.

The rap superstar known as 50 Cent was born Curtis James Jackson III in 1976. His mother, a smalltime drug dealer, was murdered when he was eight, but that didn't stop him from pursuing her profession. 50 Cent is unflinchingly honest about his mother, his drug past and just about everything else in this raw, literate memoir chronicling his rise from Jamaica, Queens, to the top of the Billboard charts. In his neighborhood, recalls 50 Cent, the only people with money were the drug dealers: "They were my role models." By 11, he'd made his first sale. Over the next decade, 50 Cent evolved from a hustler selling capsules of crack cocaine ("pieces") to a kingpin purchasing by the kilo ("weight"). With money came girls, clothes, cars&#x2014;and trouble. 50 Cent describes spraying bullets at rivals, outrunning police on his motorcycle and waking up to a drug raid on his house. He avoided jail by serving time in a boot camp&#x2013;style incarceration center, which did nothing but turn him into a "stronger, meaner, and more focused criminal." His big break into music came through a chance meeting with Jam Master Jay (of Run-DMC). Yet even while trying to break into the business, 50 Cent couldn't leave his past behind, wearing bulletproof vests to meetings with record executives and slipping back into the drug trade when his career didn't take off immediately. Fans will discover the origins of 50 Cent's famous feud with Ja Rule; they'll also get more details about the notorious 2000 shooting that left him with nine bullet holes in his body. Opinionated, unrepentant and unabashedly self-promoting, 50 Cent's memoir celebrates the rapper's peculiar brand of the American Dream (and the title of his breakthrough album): <i>Get Rich or Die Tryin'</i>. <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The illustrations are done in textured-paper collages, highlighted with pastels and colored pencils. The paper is layered to give a three-dimensional, sculptured effect. The figures are shown generally in profile and are very stylized: all of them, including an African-American boy, seem to be cut from the same silhouette. This technique gives the art a static, friezelike quality, even though motion is indicated. Also, there are few visual cues to make the transition from one scene to the next.

My life changed a lot from the moment I read the words in this book and tried to put his teaching into practice." Paulo Coelho ------------ "If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal." At some point, all of us have heard this passage from St. Paul&#x2019;s Letter to the Corinthians. But do we really understand his message? At the end of the 19th century, the young missionary Henry Drummond was asked to replace a famous preacher. Though at the beginning he did not convince the audience, they were soon captivated by his analysis of the words of the Apostle Paul. This sermon, The Greatest Thing in the World, has become a classic and is, without doubt, one of the most beautiful texts ever written on love. Drummond broke it down into the following nine elements: patience, kindness, generosity, humility, gentleness, dedication, tolerance, sincerity and innocence. Contrary to what we are used to hearing, the greatest treasure in the spiritual life is not faith, but love. No matter what your religious beliefs are, this feeling is, without doubt, the most rewarding way to live. In The Supreme Gift, Paulo Coelho adapts Henry Drummond&#x2019;s text, offering a real and powerful message that will help us incorporate love into our daily life and experience all its transformational power in our lives.</p><p>The Brazilian author PAULO COELHO is considered one of the most influential authors of our times. His books have sold more than 165 million copies worldwide, have been released in 170 countries and been translated into 80 languages. Born in Rio de Janeiro in 1947, he soon discovered his vocation for writing. He worked as a director, theater actor, songwriter and journalist. His collaboration with Brazilian composer and singer Raï¿½l Seixas gave some of the greatest classic rock songs in Brazil. In 1986, a special meeting led him to make the pilgrimage to Saint James Compostela (in Spain). The Road to Santiago was not only a common pilgrimage but a turning point in his existence. A year later, he wrote &#39;The Pilgrimage&#39;, an autobiographical novel that is considered the beginning of his career. In the following year, COELHO published &#39;The Alchemist&#39;.

Willie has been waiting years for some kind soul to dig up his leg and rebury it with the rest of him&#x2014;only then will he be at peace. Josh agrees to do the grisly deed, but when he digs in the old cemetery, he finds more than Willie&#x2019;s leg bones! Who buried the box of cash in the grave, and why? How far will that person go to get the money back? The Ghost&#x2019;s Grave is a deliciously spooky adventure from a master of suspense.</p><p>Peg Kehret was born in Wisconsin, grew up in Minnesota, spent fourteen years in California, and now lives with her husband in Washington State. They have two grown children, four grandchildren, one dog, and one cat.<p>Peg's novels for children are regularly recommended by the American Library Association, the International Reading Association, and the Children's Book Council. She has won many state "young reader" or "children's choice" awards. Peg's characters are ordinary kids who find themselves in exciting situations and who use their wits to solve their problems. There is usually humor as well as suspense in her books. A long-time volunteer at The Humane Society, she often uses animals in her stories.</p><p>Before she began writing books for children, Peg published plays, short stories, articles, and two books for adults. She is a frequent speaker at conferences for librarians and teachers.</p><p>At the age of twelve, Peg had polio and was paralyzed from the neck down. Because she can remember that experience and her year of recovery so vividly, she finds it easy to write in the viewpoint of a twelve or thirteen year old. Most of her main characters are that age. Her autobiography, <b>Small Steps: The Year I Got Polio</b>, won the Golden Kite Award from the Society of Children's Book Writers &amp; Illustrators, and the PEN Center USA West Award for Children's Literature.</p><p>When she is not writing, Peg likes to watch baseball, bake cookies, and pump her old player piano.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Grade 4-7&#x2013;Josh, 12, is furious at his mom and step-dad, who are spending their summer in India while he is trapped in Carbon City, WA. Aunt Ethel is very peculiar&#x2013;she serves dinner for breakfast and thinks the peacock living on the porch is her dead sister. Josh's luck turns when he discovers a tree house and a stray cat with kittens nearby. He also meets a ghost named Willie, who shares the tragic story of his death and convinces Josh to dig up his leg bones and reunite them with the rest of his body. When Josh stumbles upon a metal box full of money buried with Willie's leg, he heads home with the cash, planning to tell Ethel and to call the police. But she breaks her ankle and is rushed to the hospital before he gets the chance. Later that night, the owner of the cash tracks down Josh and demands it back at gunpoint. Willie, the peacock, and a quick-thinking neighbor come to Josh's aid and foil the thief. This fast-paced and engaging book should be a hit with fans of ghost stories. Josh is a rich character to whom readers can relate and they will cheer him on as he searches for the truth.<i>&#x2013;Alison Grant, West Bloomfield Township Public Library, MI</i> <br>Copyright ï¿½ Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Those were dark days for Europe as civil unrest wasspreading in Germany and neighboring countries. The Depression was destroyinghope with savage efficiency, and horrifying memories of the butchery andcarnage of the Great War were still vivid. Several in the gathering hadwitnessed firsthand the results of mankind's inhumanity and the depths to whichthose in power were capable of descending. Was humanity doomed to repeat thesenseless brutality of the World War? Was there no alternative to the hate andvitriol that seemed to define the times?<br><br>While meditating one night, an individual in thegroup who was particularly&nbsp;spiritually sensitive felt as if someone was tryingto get her attention; however, it was not one of the other members in themeeting. This was the first contact from the messengers. As she began torealize that she was channeling an entity from another realm, she also becameclear that the spiritual being was urging her to record its words. Thus, thegroup began the process of detailing these communications.<br><br>Several years later, all-out war was takingshape across Europe, and yet, the group persevered. They continued theirsessions until the bombing of London by Nazi Germany effectively ended thepossibility of further meetings. Some members sought shelter and others weredispersed in the defense of Britain.<br><br>While in refuge, one of the contemporaries inthe group befriended my grandfather and entrusted him to protect thetranscripts and notes when he emigrated to the United States.&nbsp;<br><br>I was completely unaware of the transcripts'existence until the fateful day my grandfather called me into his bedroom. Hewanted me to have them because he did not want me to grieve his imminent death.The messages, he told me, would explain our true origin and purpose as humanson Earth and give me reason to rejoice in his "transition," as herefused to call it death. My grandfather suggested that I publish the messages,as that was the original purpose of the spirits in establishing contact--thathumanity may benefit from the truths revealed. More than thirty years have passed since that day, and the wishes of mygrandfather have at last been fulfilled.<br><br>In this work you will read the original passagesdenoted in italics as they were recorded more than eighty years ago, includingtheir concept of spelling. The book follows the chronology with which themessages were recorded. You will notice the information becomes more detailedand descriptive as you advance into the material. Per the group's notes, thespirit entities initially had difficulty in conveying celestial"thoughts" and the receivers struggled to put them into the writtenword. As time passed, they became more adept at bridging the gap between thetwo worlds.<br><br>The commentary interspersed between the messagesis a combination of our writing and the group's notes. Our impressions reflectour study of metaphysics, parapsychology, and spiritual writings over manyyears.&nbsp;<br><br>Are the messages genuine? Do they come from theheavenly realms? This you must decide for yourself. David and I have no doubtin their authenticity. The truths to be found in this volume have changed ourlives and the lives of our family and friends. The messages have confirmed thevalidity of our own personal experiences. They ring true to us by the intuitivecertainty which resonates deep within our core, speaking to eternal truth: weare not human beings having a spiritual experience--we are spiritual beingshaving a human experience.<br>&nbsp;<br>Reginald H. Gray<br>AuthorFor as long as human consciousness has existed, we have wondered, "Is this all there is? If not, where do I go from here, and what happens to me after I am gone? If death is not the end of me, what comes next?"<br><br>Most of us wonder about our life before and after death. We want to know why we are born on Earth and from where we came.

He didn&#x2019;t know that the one small simple-looking engraving tool could eventually save them. Or get them killed. All he knew, in the beginning, was that the burin was impossible to use precisely, and that he was not naturally suited for metal, the way he&#x2019;d always been for canvas.</p><p>He didn&#x2019;t like the way it felt in his hand either. Oddly heavy, hard to maneuver. He felt it should create lines with the agility of a brush, or even charcoal, and yet his hand kept getting stuck, and he became repeatedly frustrated at his inability to achieve the perfect lines and grooves in the metal the way Frederick showed him. He worried that Frederick would fire him as his apprentice, and then he would have to find not only another job, but also another place to live. As Frederick&#x2019;s apprentice, Kristoff had been receiving room and board with the Faber family in their beautiful home on the out- skirts of Grotsburg, as well as five schilling a week. But most important, the opportunity to learn the trade that Frederick Faber was known for throughout Austria: engraving. His greatest creation was the country&#x2019;s most popular&#x2014;and, Kristoff would argue, artistically perfect&#x2014;postage stamp, the 12 Groschen Edelweiss. The stamp was a stunning replica of the pure white f lower, and Frederick had both designed and engraved it himself in 1932.</p><p>Kristoff remembered placing that stamp on a letter he&#x2019;d written to his mother once, but had never sent. He could not mail a letter to someone who didn&#x2019;t exist, or whose existence and location he could never determine in spite of his best efforts. But even as a young boy of thirteen, Kristoff had admired the artistry of that stamp, the perfect bows of the petals. He&#x2019;d always wanted to make a living as an artist. So when he&#x2019;d heard the rumor last fall from another street artist in Vienna, that Frederick Faber,&nbsp;<i>the&nbsp;</i>Frederick Faber, was searching for a new apprentice, Kristoff had packed up his art supplies and spent most of his small savings to hire a ride to take him the two hundred kilometers out to Grotsburg. And when he&#x2019;d arrived, he&#x2019;d convinced Frederick to give him the job after he showed Frederick some of his charcoal sketches of Vienna.</p><p>&#x201c;You have a good eye,&#x201d; Frederick had said, staring at what Kristoff thought was his most noteworthy sketch: Stephansdom, elaborate in all its detail of the two wide turrets in the front. Frederick had raised a thick gray eyebrow. &#x201c;But what do you know of metal, my boy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a quick learner,&#x201d; Kristoff had promised, and that had seemed enough to convince Frederick to take him on. Though, so far, this had turned out not to be true, at least where engraving was concerned.</p><p>Though he didn&#x2019;t master the burin right away, Kristoff did learn two things in his first few weeks working for Frederick. One, Frederick was older than Kristoff had initially thought, and sometimes his hands began to shake when he tried to teach Kristoff how to use the engraving tools. Frederick had told Kristoff he needed an apprentice because there was business enough for two master engravers to work on his stamp assignments for Austria, but now Kristoff suspected the real reason was that Frederick might not be able to continue on with his trade much longer. And Frederick didn&#x2019;t have any sons.</p><p>That was the second thing Kristoff learned. Frederick had two daughters: Elena, who was seventeen, a year younger than Kristoff, and who reminded Kristoff of the edelweiss with her snowy skin, waves of long light brown hair, and bright green eyes. And Miriam, who was thirteen. If Elena was a flower, then Miriam was the buzzing bee who wouldn&#x2019;t leave the flower alone. Or, as Mrs. Faber called her with an exasperated roll of her green eyes, a&nbsp;<i>flibbertigibbet</i>. But Kristoff still found her amusing, even when her family did not.</p><p>Kristoff quickly became accustomed to life in Grotsburg, where the world was green and very quiet, and instead of buildings and throngs of people, he woke up each morning to a view of the forest and rolling hills. But even more, Kristoff reveled in the warmth of the Fabers&#x2019; dining room, of the fragrant smell of Mrs. Faber&#x2019;s stews, of the bread they broke on Friday nights in the glow of their candles. The challah was a savory bread, and Kristoff had never tasted anything like it growing up in the orphanage in Vienna, where the nuns had led him to believe there was only one religion anyway. Not that he was necessarily a believer. Kristoff was much more drawn to the Fabers, the light and wholeness of their family, than he had ever been to God or the institutional church.</p><p>&#x201c;Miriam, sit still,&#x201d; Mrs. Faber chastised, one night a few weeks after Kristoff had begun his apprenticeship. Almost a month in, Kristoff was still failing miserably at the metalwork. Though earlier that day he had impressed Frederick with his sketch of the hillside, and even hours later, he was still basking in Frederick&#x2019;s compliment that it was &#x201c;not half bad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sitting still, Mother,&#x201d; Miriam said in a singsong voice, bouncing slightly in her chair and casting a sideways smile at Kristoff.</p><p>Kristoff hid his own smile in his spoonful of soup. He glanced at Elena, but she refused to look at him. He had yet to determine whether she was shy or rude, whether she acted so standoffish around everyone, or whether it was just around him.</p><p>&#x201c;Elena, dear. Go fetch another log or two for the fire. It&#x2019;s chilly in here,&#x201d; Mrs. Faber said. It was the deepest, coldest part of winter, and the Faber&#x2019;s three-story wooden house was drafty. Kristoff &#x2019;s room in the attic had a small woodstove, but he had to huddle under two blankets to stay warm at night. Still, it far surpassed the orphanage, his bed in a row of ten others in a large cold room, and only a thin blanket to cover him. And Mrs. Faber&#x2019;s cooking was much better than the nuns&#x2019;.</p><p>Elena put her soup spoon down and stood. Kristoff tried to meet her eyes again, but she wouldn&#x2019;t look up.</p><p>&#x201c;I can help.&#x201d; Kristoff stood, before he lost his nerve, and Elena turned toward him. At least he&#x2019;d caught her attention.</p><p>Her beautiful face sunk into a frown. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not&#x2014;&#x201d; she began.</p><p>Mrs. Faber spoke over her: &#x201c;Thank you, Kristoff. I&#x2019;m sure Elena would appreciate that.&#x201d;</p><p>He smiled at Mrs. Faber and followed Elena. They went wordlessly through the kitchen, out the back door, toward the woodpile, which rested across the Fabers&#x2019; sprawling yard in front of Frederick&#x2019;s workshop. The earth was frozen, and the ground crunched beneath their feet; the night air was biting and neither Kristoff nor Elena had grabbed a coat. Elena shivered, and her hair fell into her eyes as she reached down to grab the wood. Kristoff resisted the urge to pull it back, and instead reached down and took the log from her hands.</p><p>&#x201c;Really,&#x201d; she said sharply, pulling it back and holding it toward her chest. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just fine. I&#x2019;ve been doing this on my own long before you came here. I don&#x2019;t need your help.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I want to help,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s no trouble.&#x201d; Elena glared, and he was suddenly certain that she was not shy&#x2014;she just didn&#x2019;t like him. And this realization bothered him. He had the urge to fix it.</p><p>But before he could say more, Elena turned and began to walk back toward the house. Kristoff picked up another log from the pile and ran after her. He caught her just before they reached the back door, and he reached for her shoulder. &#x201c;Have I done something?&#x201d; he asked her, slightly out of breath from running in the cold. His words came out jagged and smoky against the chilly air.</p><p>&#x201c;Something?&#x201d; she echoed back.</p><p>&#x201c;To upset you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why should you think that?&#x201d; Her breath made frosty rings in the air, and she shivered again.</p><p>&#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;We should get back inside. You&#x2019;re freezing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just that we&#x2019;re not friends, okay. We&#x2019;re not going to be friends. I don&#x2019;t expect you to be here long. They never are.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They?&#x201d; he asked, considering, for the first time, Frederick&#x2019;s last apprentice, or maybe his last few? Were they all terrible with the burin, like him, and promptly fired?</p><p>But Elena didn&#x2019;t answer. She carried the wood inside and placed it into the fire. Kristoff did the same, and then he excused himself to go to bed. Up in the attic, wrapped in two blankets, he took out his sketch pad and a nib of charcoal. He found himself sketching Elena&#x2019;s angry green eyes and wondering how long this place would stay his home.</p></p><h2>The Twelve Powers of Man</h2><p>The Twelve Powers of Man is a metaphysical look at twelve expressions of the divine power inherent in each of us. Expressions such as love, faith, strength, zeal, and imagination are discussed. JESUS prophesied the advent of a race of men who would sit with Him on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. This book explains the meaning of this mystical reference, what and where the twelve thrones are, and what attainments are necessary by man before he can follow Jesus in this phase of his regeneration. Regeneration follows generation in the development of man. Generation sustains and perpetuates the human; regeneration unfolds and glorifies the divine. It is not expected that beginners in the study of metaphysical Christianity will understand this book. It deals with forces that function below and above the field of the conscious mind. The average religious thinker knows nothing about the subconscious mind and very little about the superconscious; this book presupposes a working knowledge of both. This book aims to clear up the mystery that ever envelops the advent, life, and death of Jesus. To the superficial reader of the Gospels His life was a tragedy and, so far as concerns the kingly reign that was prophesied, it was a failure. Yet those who understand the subtlety of the soul and supremacy of Spirit see that Jesus was conqueror of a psychic force that was destroying the human race. (Text taken from a previous edition).</p><p>Charles Sherlock Fillmore (1854 &#x2013;1948), born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, founded Unity, a church within the New Thought movement, with his wife, Myrtle Page Fillmore, in 1889. He became known as an American mystic for his contributions to metaphysical interpretations of Biblical scripture. An ice skating accident when he was ten broke Fillmore's hip and left him with life-long disabilities. He met his future wife, Mary Caroline Page, known as Myrtle, in Denison, Texas in the mid-1870s. After losing his job there, he moved to Gunnison, Colorado where he worked at mining and real estate. He married Myrtle in Clinton, Missouri on March 29, 1881 and the newlyweds moved to Pueblo, Colorado, where Charles established a real estate business with the brother-in-law of Nona Lovell Brooks, who was later to found the Church of Divine Science. After the births of their first two sons, Lowell Page and Waldo Rickert Fillmore, the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri. Two years later, in 1886, Charles and Myrtle attended New Thought classes held by Dr. E. B. Weeks. Myrtle subsequently recovered from chronic tuberculosis and attributed her recovery to her use of prayer and other methods learned in Weeks's classes. Subsequently Charles began to heal from his childhood accident, a development which he too attributed to following this philosophy. Charles Fillmore became a devoted student of philosophy and religion. In 1889, Charles left his business to focus entirely on a prayer group that would later be called 'Silent Unity'. It was named this because of a legal conflict with Mary Baker Eddy over the use of the title Christian Science. That same year he began publication of a new periodical, 'Modern Thought', notable among other things as the first publication to accept for publication the writings of the then 27-year-old New Thought pioneer William Walker Atkinson. Although Charles had no intention of making Unity into a denomination, his students wanted a more organized group. He and his wife were among the first ordained Unity ministers in 1906. Charles and Myrtle Fillmore operated the Unity organization from a campus near downtown Kansas City.</p><h2>Trauma: Teaching kids all about trauma</h2><p>Best Seller!

He was newly graduated from law school at the University of Texas at Austin. For his service, he received food stamps and a monthly stipend of $250. A year later he was hired as a staff attorney. He has been the Director of Legal Services since 1980. He played a pivotal role in the development of disability law nationally. He helped break ground in implementing special education law, and his work in this arena is legendary. Parents report that simply invoking his name has moved recalcitrant school district personnel to provide appropriate services for their children. His influence is reflected in state statute and policy. In the developmental disabilities area, he established Human Rights Committees in legislation to review medications, behavioral programs, and ensure investigation of abuse and neglect. He added the requirement that people with developmental disabilities be represented on the board of directors of community service organizations. He also drafted the due process language in the state statute and had significant input in the development of the Colorado Department of Education&#39; s complaint process for children in special education. He has overseen legal representation to more than 10,000 people with disabilities in Colorado and made more than 500 presentations on disability law. He is also the author of numerous articles, two video scripts, and the co-author of a book on Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act. He lives in Golden, Colorado, with his wife and two sons.Excellent book to have on hand at schools for parents and teachers to use. I work with students with disabilities and I learned a ton from this book. I will often refer to it as time goes on. The tidbits for parents are so beneficial. For example, letting a parent know what happens when they move in-state or to another state. This book has great information for parents and is a wonderful tool as it is easily readable and clear. --Colorado Independent Publishers Association Judges comments<br><br>A lot of things that weren't being done now they re going back and doing them.

Any act!</b><br><br> Olive &#x201c;clicks&#x201d; with everyone in the fifth grade&#x2014;until one day she doesn&#x2019;t. When a school variety show leaves Olive stranded without an act to join, she begins to panic, wondering why all her friends have already formed their own groups . . . without her. With the performance drawing closer by the minute, will Olive be able to find her own place in the show before the curtain comes up?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Author-illustrator Kayla Miller has woven together a heartfelt and insightful story about navigating friendships, leaning on family, and learning to take the stage in the most important role of all.<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Kayla Miller</b> is an illustrator and cartoonist with a BFA from the University of Arts in Philadelphia. She is the creator of Creep, a web comic series about a boy who gains weird superhero-like powers. Kayla regularly attends conventions to promote her work and meet other artists. tapastic.com/series/CreepGr 3-6-Outgoing fifth grader Olive has a problem: she's good friends with almost everyone in her class, but she isn't&nbsp;best&nbsp;friends with anyone. She's perfectly happy in her role as floating social butterfly until it comes time for the big variety show, when all her friends form acts without her before she realizes what's going on. Olive sinks slowly into depression as she fails to "click" with any of her cliquey friend groups, until funky, green-haired Aunt Molly invites her over for an aunt-niece sleepover. After spending the night watching old TV variety shows, Olive is inspired by the witty hosts and hostesses who introduce and banter with the acts on their shows, and dreams about taking on that role herself for the variety show. Can she convince her friends and family that this is the right fit for her? Heavy lines and calm pastels create the perfect tone to offset this introspective story of self-discovery. Well-defined, consistent frames and gutters, along with clear-cut visual storytelling and readable lettering, make this an excellent recommendation for fans of the format and newcomers alike. VERDICT Those who enjoy Raina Telgemeier, Victoria Jamieson, and the like will find this a lighter but welcome addition and be happy to hear Olive's adventures will continue.-Darla Salva Cruz, Suffolk Cooperative Library System, Bellport, NY&#x3b1;(c) Copyright 2011.

However, you must also be able to combine them into a process that fits the context and needs of your organization and guide people through this new way of working.</p><p>This book only contains the building blocks&#x2014;the methods. It doesn&#x2019;t detail how to assemble them into a cohesive design process or how to plan or manage it.

(Publishers Weekly)<br><br>A terrific Halloween read-aloud. (Booklist)</p><h2>Poland - Culture Smart!: The Essential Guide to Customs &amp; Culture</h2><p>The changes in Polish life, culture, economics, and development have been remarkable. And the pace of change shows little sign of abating. Through twenty-five years of post-Communist transformation and ten years as a member of the European Union, some Polish cities, like Warsaw, Krakï¿½w, Poznan, and Wroclaw, have experienced an economic renaissance thanks largely to direct foreign investment, EU funds, and an influx of tourists. Much of the countryside, and cities like Lï¿½dz and Lublin, however, are shadows of their former selves. The mass emigration of Polish workers following European integration has had as significant an effect on Poland as it has on the destination countries, such as the UK. Despite a crisis of confidence in the country&#x2019;s direction, a swing toward political populism, and the tragic death of the Polish president in the Smolensk disaster of 2010, Poland is the only EU member not to have suffered economic contraction in the years following the 2007&#x2013;08 global financial crisis. That Poland continues to develop in growth and influence is a testament to the legendary Polish resolve in the face of adversity. This new, updated edition of <i>Culture Smart! Poland </i>provides visitors with an insight into everyday life in today&#x2019;s Poland. From the country&#x2019;s rich and tragic history to the growth of a modern economy, from the rustic rural countryside to the Warsaw hipster scene, the reader will gain an appreciation of Polish culture much deeper than that to be found in conventional travel guides.</p><p><b>Gregory Allen, Ph.D.</b>, is a Senior Lecturer at the University of Bolton, specializing in cross-cultural management in Central and Eastern Europe and contemporary philosophy.

The avid interest in hand lettering seemingly goes hand in hand with the weariness audiences feel with constant slick digital presentation of the information they consume.&nbsp;<i>The Art of Lettering</i>&nbsp;collects myriad new and established graphic designers for whom hand lettering is a time-honored art that has modern applications. Showcasing more than 100 artists from all over the world, the book displays their typographic takes and illustrates their perfectly imperfect handcrafted art, from beautiful photographs of concept sketches to the end result. Straying away from traditional pen calligraphy, artists today employ new and creative approaches, including building type with coffee grounds, watercolors, and combinations of different hand tools, resulting in a dynamically fresh approach to creating type.</p><p><b>Brooke Robinson</b> &nbsp;is a graphic designer based in Austin, TX.

The motivation behind Goodtype is Brooke Robinson&#x2019;s &nbsp;insatiable love of lettering. She collected examples by the bushel&#x2014;and stored them all on her phone. When she got to the point where she would have to delete samples to gather more, it hit her: she could upload all of the images to an Instagram account dedicated to her lettering and type finds. This was in 2013, and Robinson never looked back. But there&#x2019;s more to Goodtype than its collection of drop-to-your-knees lettering. In a world of bits and bytes, we seldom see design projects in their evolutionary stages. Goodtype, however, gives us a look over the designer&#x2019;s shoulder as the lettering evolves.

Adults have stout bodies and dark, dull-colored forewings with mottled or barklike patterns that they hold over their back while at rest. As a result, they are highly camouflaged when sitting on tree trunks, a common location to find them during daylight hours. However, when disturbed, underwing moths quickly spread their wings to reveal much brighter hind wings below before flying off to a nearby tree. Colored with bands of red, pink, yellow, orange, and even white, this hind wing pattern, coupled with their rapid wing motion, may help to startle interested predators. The showy nature of this group has made them popular with collectors and naturalists alike. Active at night, underwing moths are commonly attracted to artificial lights or may readily be drawn to sugar baits.</p><p> </p><p>Believe It or Not: Underwing moths have simple ears that enable them to hear the ultrasound of a night-hunting bat.

The sizable giant leopard moths are common at artificial lights. If disturbed, they often drop to the ground and temporarily play dead. When doing so, they curl up their plump abdomens to reveal a bold-orange-and-iridescent-blue pattern, likely serving to scare off potential predators. If further molested, the moth secretes acrid yellow droplets from glands in its thorax. The large larvae are deep black with bright red rings on their bodies. They have a broad host range, feeding on a wide assortment of different plants and may readily move from one species to another. Fully grown larvae may reach three inches in length and are often spotted wandering along the ground in fall as they search for a protected site in which to overwinter.</p><p> </p><p>Believe It or Not: Aptly named, the giant leopard moth is the largest tiger moth found in eastern North America.</p><p></p></p><h2>You Wouldn&#39;t Want to Live Without Clean Water!

A prolific author, Vos&#39;s published writings include articles, essays, reviews, poems, and biblical-theological studies on both Old and New Testament topics. The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Kingdom of God (1903) and his study of Pauline theology, The Pauline Eschatology (1930), remain two of his most important works. Vos&#39;s approach to the theology of the Old and New Testaments was published in 1948 as Biblical Theology (reprinted by the Trust in 1975).

Follow&nbsp;@hbryant42<b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WITH HOWARD BRYANT!<br><br>Q</b>. You have written three award-winning non-fiction books for adult readers. You&#x2019;re also frequently in the public eye &#x2013; on TV and radio. Why did you choose to turn your attention to younger readers?<br><br><b>A</b>. The biggest reason I turned to younger readers is because my nine-year old son, Ilan, is a voracious reader and budding tennis player. He loves to read and enjoys sports and Penguin gave us the opportunity to do something collaborative. It is a wonderful challenge to write subjects he may be interested in.&nbsp;The other reason is just as personal. I love words. I live to write and I loved reading when I was a child. Then, as I reached middle school and became devoured by my love of playing sports, I read less and less and didn't rediscover my love of reading until after high school. I hope this series offers young athletes who love both sports and reading to have both, to serve as a reminder that you can play sports while learning about them at the same time.<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Q</b>. Why the inclusion of so many Top Ten lists within the book?<br><br><b>A</b>. Baseball has such a great history, we realized by the end of the book that some of the greatest names in the game were not mentioned, so the Top 10 lists were designed to be a fast way to give respect and mention to some of the greats--like Ted Williams and Joe DiMaggio--as well as include some lesser-known but important moments in baseball. A few of the lists provide statistical leaderboards so readers can learn about some great names they've likely never heard of.</p><h2>Today I&#39;m a Monster (Cozy Reading Nook)</h2><p><b>A CUTE STORY WITH A GREAT AND IMPORTANT MESSAGE</b><ul><li>Explains that angry feelings come and go&nbsp;</li><li>Doing bad things doesn't make you bad&nbsp;</li><li>A story is a good way to help children first recognize feelings&nbsp;</li><li>Learn to treat each other better as well as be more tolerating&nbsp;</li><li>Teaches us all that love and understanding make the difference&nbsp;</li><li>AND showers the power of a mother's love&nbsp;</li></ul><b>It will deeply touch a mother's heart</b>&nbsp;<br><i></i><i>"I'll admit this brought tears to my eyes while reading it to my daughter.

Van Gelder. She lives in Templeton, CA.Grade 1-3-This title focuses on one emperor penguin family's survival. The parents' care of their young is central, shown by deft yet perfunctory watercolors depicting a harsh, challenging habitat. The danger of the baby's starvation is emphasized; one adult must keep it protected from the elements and the other must fish for food and return in time to feed it before it dies. Trading places, the caregivers share these duties until the chick is old enough for both adult birds to hunt for food together. A summary of a penguin's life up to the laying of an egg is followed by a section that describes the egg laying and nesting patterns of kings, Ad lies, rockhoppers, jackasses, and little blues. Brenda Guiberson's The Emperor Lays an Egg (Holt, 2001) and Martin Jenkins's The Emperor's Egg (Candlewick, 1999) will have wider appeal because of their sparkling language and vibrant art.

The novel was written by a first-time author, and the film option was snapped up by aging heartthrob Robert Redford for 3 million smackers. Why take such risks on a brand-spanking-new author? The answer becomes clear upon reading the touching tale.<p> One morning while teenage Grace Maclean is riding Pilgrim, her goofy, loveable pony, she has a horrendous glass-shattering, bone-splintering, ligament-lynching meeting with a megaton truck that leaves her and her four-legged friend damaged in mind, body, and spirit. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, her jaded, brilliant, bitchy mom, Annie Graves (Kristin Scott Thomas in the 1998 film) is working out a wrinkle in her self-absorbed existence when she gets a call at her plush, Manhattan office about Grace's accident. Racked with guilt, Graves makes it her calling to find the mythical horse whisperer, an equine Zen master who has the ability to heal horses (and broken souls) with soothing words and a gentle touch. Just when it seems he can't be found, what do you know, she finds him. He arrives in the form of Tom Booker-- a rugged, sensitive, dreamy cowboy who helps Pilgrim and Grace repair their fractured selves. To add more mesquite to fire, Booker has a way with not-so-injured, attractive, married women--like Annie. As the plot thickens, so does the familial strife, which threatens to undo Booker's healing work.</p><p> Like an expert cinematographer, Evans deftly crafts each scene with precision and clarity, sprinkling in ominous signs and foreboding images. For example, in the opening paragraphs, as Annie starts out on the tragic ride, she comes across a bloody bird wing that seems to have fallen out of nowhere. The weight of impending doom is further strengthened by the truck driver's bad luck--he has a run-in with the highway patrol just moments before his meeting with Grace and Pilgrim. These not-so-subtle subliminal messages are masterfully stitched in throughout the story and may compel readers to act as if they were watching a B-grade horror movie, shouting aloud, "Don't go there!" However sentimental, <i>The Horse Whisperer</i> is an engaging read, sort of like a finely tuned, well-edited film. <i>--Rebekah Warren</i></p><p>A forty-ton truck hurtles out of control on a snowy country road, a teenagegirl on horseback in its path.

Annie has riskedeverything -- her career, her marriage, her comfortable life -- in her desperatebelief that the Whisperer can help them. The accident has turned Pilgrimsavage. He is now so demented and dangerous that everyone says he should bedestroyed. But Annie won't give up on him, for she feels his fate isinextricably entwined with that of her daughter, who has retreated into aheartrending, hostile silence. Annie knows that if the horse dies, somethingin Grace will die too.</p><p>In the weeks to come, under the massive sky of the Rocky Mountain Front, alltheir lives -- including Tom Booker's -- will be transformed forever in a waynone could have foretold.

Yet in an age in which it has become fashionable to "forgive yourself" rather than to forgive others, can our modern ways of understanding guilt, blame, mercy, and justice be reconciled with Jesus' teaching?</p><p>Pastor John MacArthur begins The Freedom and Power of Forgiveness by examining the doctrine of the atonement, the basis for any teaching on forgiveness. He then answers some common questions about forgiveness, such as: Why are we supposed to seek God's forgiveness if he has already justified us? How should we handle repeat offenses against us? When is restitution appropriate? MacArthur then presents potent, relevant biblical principles of forgiveness.</p></p><p><p><strong>John MacArthur</strong>&nbsp;is the&nbsp;pastor-teacher of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, California, where he has served since 1969.

Purified ones they are, who have renounced the life of this sphere in order to guard and protect the Flame, that spiritual principle in man, now hidden beneath the ruins of his fallen temple.As we think of the nations that are past, of Greece and Rome and the grandeur that was Egypt&#x2019;s, we sigh as we recall the story of their fall; and we watch the nations of today, not knowing which will be the next to draw its shroud around itself and join that great ghostly file of peoples that are dead.But everywhere, even in the rise and fall of nations, we see through the haze of materiality, justice; everywhere we see reward, not of man but of the invincible One, the eternal Flame.A great hand reaches out from the unseen and regulates the affairs of man. It reaches out from that great spiritual Flame which nourishes all created things, the never dying fire that burns on the sacred altar of Cosmos&#x2014;that great fire which is the spirit of God.If we turn again to the races now dead, we shall, if we look, find the cause of their destruction. The light had gone out. When the flame within the body is withdrawn, the body is dead. When the light was taken from the altar, the temple was no longer the dwelling place of a living God.Degeneracy, lust, and passion, hates and fears, crept into the souls of Greece and Rome, and Black Magic overshadowed Egypt; the light upon the altar grew weaker and weaker. The priests lost the Word, the name of the Flame. Little by little the Flame flickered out, and as the last spark grew cold, a mighty nation died, buried beneath the dead ashes of its own spiritual fire.But the Flame did not die. Like spirit of which it is the essence, it cannot die, because it is life, and life cannot cease to be. In some wilderness of land or sea it rested once again, and there rose a mighty nation around that flame. So history goes on through the ages. As long as a people are true to the Flame, it remains, but when they cease to nourish it with their lives, it goes on to other lands and other worlds.In the pages that follow we will try to show this great thread, the spiritual thread, the thread of living fire that winds in and out through all religions and binds them together with a mutual ideal and mutual needs. In the story of the Grail and the Legends of King Arthur we find that thread wound around the Table of the King and the Temple of Mount Salvart. This same thread of life that passes through the roses of the Rosicrucians, winds among the pedals of the Lotus, and among the temple pillars of Luxor. THERE IS BUT ONE RELIGION IN ALL THE WORLD, and that is the worship of God, the spiritual Flame of the universe. We are the Flame-Born Sons of God, thrown out as sparks from the wheels of the infinite. Around this Flame we have built forms which have hidden our light, but as students we are increasing this light by love and service, until it shall again proclaim us Suns of the Eternal.Within us burns that Flame, and before Its altar the lower man must bow, a faithful servant of the Higher. When he serves the Flame he grows, and the light grows until he takes his place with the true Initiates of the universe, those who have given all to the Infinite, in the name of the Flame within.Let us find this Flame and also serve it, realizing that it is in all created things, that all are one because all are part of that eternal Flame, the fire of spirit, the life and power of the universe.Upon the altar of this Flame, to the true creator of this book, the writer offers it, and dedicates it to the one Fire which blazes forth from God, and is now hidden within each living thing.</p><p>Dennis Logan is a professional audio book narrator, recording engineer and producer operating in Richmond, VA.

For over 350 years, proving Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem was the most notorious unsolved mathematical problem, a puzzle whose basics most children could grasp but whose solution eluded the greatest minds in the world. In 1993, after years of secret toil, Englishman Andrew Wiles announced to an astounded audience that he had cracked Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem. He had no idea of the nightmare that lay ahead. In &#39;Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem&#39; Simon Singh has crafted a remarkable tale of intellectual endeavour spanning three centuries, and a moving testament to the obsession, sacrifice and extraordinary determination of Andrew Wiles: one man against all the odds.</p><p>When Andrew Wiles of Princeton University announced a solution of Fermat's last theorem in 1993 it electrified the world of mathematics. After a flaw was discovered in the proof, Wiles had to work for another year--he had already labored in solitude for seven years--to establish that he had solved the 350-year-old problem. Simon Singh's book is a lively, comprehensible explanation of Wiles's work and of the star-, trauma-, and wacko-studded history of Fermat's last theorem. <i>Fermat's Enigma</i> contains some problems that offer a taste for the math, but it also includes limericks to give a feeling for the goofy side of mathematicians."An excellent account of one of the most dramatic and moving events of the century."<br>--Sir Roger Penrose, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><p>"It is hard to imagine a more gripping account of...this centuries-long drama of ingenious failures, crushed hopes, fatal duels, and suicides."<br>--Jim Holt, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></p><p>"Though Singh may not ask us to bring too much algebra to the table, he does expect us to appreciate a good detective story." <br><i>--Boston Sunday Globe</i></p><p>"The history of mathematics comes alive even for those who dread balancing their checkbooks." <br><i>--Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Singh captures the joys and frustrations of this quest for an extremely elusive proof...and builds to a truly engrossing climax. It's a mathematical page-turner."<br><i>--Library Journal</i></p><p></p></p><h2>Searching for the Pattern: My Journey in Interpreting the Bible</h2><p><p><strong>MOVING FROM A &#x201c;BLUEPRINT HERMENEUTIC&#x201d; TO A THEOLOGICAL ONE</strong></p><p>In this book, John Mark Hicks tells the story of his own hermeneutical journey in reading the Bible. Lovingly and graciously, he describes his transition from a &#x201c;blueprint hermeneutic&#x201d; to a theological one. Some suggest that moving away from a patternistic command-example-and-necessary-inference approach for understanding what God requires leaves no other alternative, or at least none that both respects biblical authority and seeks to obey the gospel of Jesus the Messiah. </p><p>In <em>Searching for the Pattern</em>, John Mark offers just such an alternative. His theological hermeneutic is deeply rooted in the way the Bible presents itself as a dramatic history of God&#x2019;s plan to redeem the world as well as his own experience of growing up among Churches of Christ. Seeing the gospel of Jesus as the center of the biblical drama reorients us to what provides our Christian identity and unites us as disciples of Jesus.</p><p>I pray this book is received with open hearts and open minds because I believe this work could go a long way in helping to bring unity to our fractured fellowship.&nbsp;</p><p>&#x2014;<strong><em>Wes McAdams</em></strong><em>, Preaching Minister for the church of Christ on McDermott Road, Plano, Texas</em></p><p>This excellent book helps us understand the inner workings of Bible interpretation among Churches of Christ and provides a persuasive proposal for Bible interpretation that is built on the story of God we find in Scripture&#x2014;a story into which God calls us. </p><p>&#x2014;<strong><em>James L. Gorman</em></strong><em>, Associate Professor of History, Johnson University<br> Knoxville, Tennessee</em></p><p>Finally, a trellis across the chasm! Throughout this book, Hicks does not compromise his high regard for both the church and the Scriptures; and through the grace found therein, he composes this urgent invitation back to the Table, where obedience cooperates with mystery, and we&#x2014;estranged or conflicted&#x2014;can find our place as one within God&#x2019;s magnificent story. </p><p>&#x2014;<strong><em>Tiffany Mangan Dahlman</em></strong><em>, Minister at Courtyard Church of Christ,<br> Fayetteville, North Carolina</em></p><p><strong>John Mark Hicks</strong>&nbsp;is Professor of Theology at Lipscomb University in Nashville, Tennessee.

"Kangaroo child Norma Jean loves to jump. The problem is that her jumping gets out of hand, causing accidents and some ruffled feelings among her friends, and Norma stops her jumping entirely. But when the school's field-day games come up, Norma Jean is coaxed back into action long enough to win ribbons.

And her jumping gets in the way of playshe knocks down frog Neal'stower of blocks, spills pig Sara's milk, bounces Ted the bear off the seesaw and splashes a cross porcupine named Amy out of her pool. One mean remark from a friend, and Norma Jean has had it. She starts walking through puddles instead of jumping, and declining jump roping and jumping contests on Field Day. But when good-hearted Norma Jean cheers for her friends, she just has to jump; the kangaroo regains her congenital itch to hop.

The debate is one of the biggest in economics, and the value or futility of investment management and financial regulation hangs on the answer. In this groundbreaking book, Andrew Lo transforms the debate with a powerful new framework in which rationality and irrationality coexist&#x2015;the Adaptive Markets Hypothesis. Drawing on psychology, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and other fields, <i>Adaptive Markets</i> shows that the theory of market efficiency is incomplete. When markets are unstable, investors react instinctively, creating inefficiencies for others to exploit. Lo&#x2019;s new paradigm explains how financial evolution shapes behavior and markets at the speed of thought&#x2015;a fact revealed by swings between stability and crisis, profit and loss, and innovation and regulation. An ambitious new answer to fundamental questions about economics and investing, <i>Adaptive Markets</i> is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how markets really work.</p></p><p><p>"Andrew Lo combines wonderfully broad scholarship and a delightfully instructive style to present dramatically new perspectives on how markets work and how they can be regulated more effectively. This important book will teach and entertain, and should influence those charged with keeping markets healthy."<b>--Simon A. Levin, Princeton University</b></p><p>"<i>Adaptive Markets</i> will appeal to anyone who distrusts dogmatic economic theories and thirsts for a coherent view of how market economies produce both great gain and great pain for societies. Andrew Lo integrates a deep understanding of finance with a broad knowledge of biology, psychology, and ethics to offer a tantalizing vision of how financial engineering could become a powerful force for a more just, healthy, and prosperous world."<b>--Peter Hancock, President and CEO, AIG</b></p><p>"We tell stories, we learn from them, and we make them up. In this magnificent book, Andrew Lo explains how our attraction to stories drives markets, explains past catastrophes, and suggests future opportunities for world-saving financial engineering. And he packages it all in fascinating stories of his own."<b>--Patrick Henry Winston, Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b></p><p>"Andrew Lo is a brilliant financial economist, visionary innovator, bold contrarian, gifted writer, and an unrelenting idealist. These traits are evident in this wonderful book, which traces the 'evolutionary explosion of financial innovation' that began with Vanguard's creation of the first index mutual fund in 1974, tracking the S&amp;P 500 Index. I continue to hold to index funds, but Dr. Lo's book persuades me to keep a mind that is open--or at least ajar--to the new world of investment technology, investor preferences, and transaction efficiency, and to the wisdom of those who are smarter than I am."<b>--John C. Bogle, founder of the Vanguard Group and the First Index Mutual Fund, and author of <i>The Little Book of Common Sense Investing</i></b></p><p>"This is a wonderful book. Andrew Lo traces a journey in which he reconsiders rationality in economics, moving from the efficient market hypothesis to his own Adaptive Markets Hypothesis through psychology, neuroscience, biology, and studies of financial innovations and crises. The book presents many valuable findings and is also full of emotion--enthusiasm, joy, frustration, and pain. It is itself a manifestation of the important finding that rational thinking and emotion go together."<b>Nobuhiro Kiyotaki, Princeton University</b></p><b>Andrew W.

Seeking a sense of home and identity, she would discover both while moving from spectator to creator in experiencing the power and mystery of a live performance. With Sleater-Kinney, Brownstein and her bandmates rose to prominence in the burgeoning underground feminist punk-rock movement that would define music and pop culture in the 1990s. They would be cited as &#x201c;America&#x2019;s best rock band&#x201d; by legendary music critic Greil Marcus for their defiant, exuberant brand of punk that resisted labels and limitations, and redefined notions of gender in rock.<br> &nbsp;<br> HUNGER MAKES ME A MODERN GIRL is an intimate and revealing narrative of her escape from a turbulent family life into a world where music was the means toward self-invention, community, and rescue. Along the way, Brownstein chronicles the excitement and contradictions within the era&#x2019;s flourishing and fiercely independent music subculture, including experiences that sowed the seeds for the observational satire of the popular television series <i>Portlandia</i> years later.<br> &nbsp;<br> With deft, lucid prose Brownstein proves herself as formidable on the page as on the stage. Accessibly raw, honest and heartfelt, this book captures the experience of being a young woman, a born performer and an outsider, and ultimately finding one&#x2019;s true calling through hard work, courage and the intoxicating power of rock and roll.</p></p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of November 2015:</strong> <em>Hunger Made Me a Modern Girl</em> isn't the stately, studio-oriented music memoir that we've seen in the wake of Keith Richards's epic <em>Life</em>--Townshend, Costello, and others--but perhaps most closely resembles Chrissie Hynde's <em>Reckless</em>, at least in spirit, if not content: both are relatively short, intensely personal, and less concerned with chord progressions than personal progression (Hynde&#x2019;s being particularly gritty). Moving through her childhood in the Seattle suburbs, we see the proto-performer searching for her personal stage while navigating tumultuous family dynamics. And when she finds her voice with the pioneering punk band, Sleater-Kinney, we&#x2019;re in the van and on stage with her, lugging amps and filthy mattresses until road-stress compels her to end it (the first time, anyway; they&#x2019;re back). It's not a tell-all; Brownstein is selective about what she shares, but what she does give us hits hard. Her memoir resembles her songs: taut, thoughtful, and honest. <em> &#x2013;Jon Foro</em></p><p><b>Carrie Brownstein</b> is a musician, writer and actor who first became widely known as the guitarist and vocalist of the band Sleater-Kinney and later as a creator, writer and co-star of the Emmy-nominated, Peabody Award winning television show <i>Portlandia</i>.&nbsp;Brownstein's writing has appeared in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Believer</i>, <i>Slate,</i>&nbsp;and numerous anthologies on music and culture.

I'm not saying that putting on makeup will change the world or even your life, but it can be a first step in learning things about yourself you may never have discovered otherwise." </i>- Kevyn Aucoin, from his introduction<b><br></b>Kevyn Aucoin is one of the beauty industry's most innovative makeup artists. Over his decades-long career, he's created iconic looks for everyone from Julianne Moore to Gwyneth Paltrow to Mary J. Blige and Cher. <br>With clear step-by-step illustrations and instructions for creating hundreds of makeup looks for any occasion, <i>Face Forward</i> lets readers bring Aucoin's expertise with them wherever they go.<br>More than merely a how-to guide, this gorgeous book is a perfect gift and a sumptuous inspiration for a beautiful life.</p><p>"Makeup should be fun, not fascist," celebrity makeup artist Kevyn Aucoin avers in <i>Face Forward</i>, his third book. One of the most adored stylists among fashionistas, entertainment divas, and high-society jet setters, Southern-born Aucoin arrived on the New York fashion scene in the early '80s, a period he ridicules for its '50s-era conservatism and McCarthyist us-against-them values. His career since has been motivated by the feel-good ideals of acceptance, diversity, and self-love, and the vain world of beauty has eagerly participated in his vision. While one may puzzle on how it is he finds fulfillment in an industry known for its superficiality and elitism, Aucoin's words are nonetheless infectious and the touches of his brushes inspired.<p> Conceived as an exploration of the past, present, and future of beauty, <i>Face Forward</i> is an ingenious showcase of the transformative, creative possibilities of makeup, with portraits of everyone from Julia Roberts to Sharon Stone, Martha Stewart to his mother, Thelma. His crafted visages range from minimal-application makeovers of friends to elaborate re-creations of such Hollywood icons as Audrey Hepburn (Calista Flockhart), James Dean (Gwyneth Paltrow), and Veronica Lake (shockingly, Martha Stewart) and such pop-culture personalities as Cher (socialite Alexandra von Furstenberg) and Siouxsie Sioux (Winona Ryder). The final pages present his ideas for looks to come, such as "Explorer," Mary J. Blige covered in eggplant body makeup with a rainbow of metallic eye shadows over her eyes and thickly glossed red lips; "Floralia," a freckled Lucy Liu resembling a sprite from <i>A Midsummer's Night Dream</i>; and "Venusian de Milo," Sharon Stone as an orange-haired, one-breast-baring sci-fi femme fatale. Throughout, Aucoin augments an already colorful book with step-by-step instruction, chatty commentary on each look and model, and riffs on such topics as friendship, politics (he repeatedly applauds the Clinton Administration for embracing diversity in the '90s), and the environment.</p><p> "Appreciating (even highlighting) individuality is one of the great things about makeup," asserts Aucoin, and <i>Face Forward</i> is a dazzling testament to that belief. For those who see the fun of makeup and are eager to experiment with the virtually unlimited possibilities of it, this book is a boon. <i>--Rebecca Wright</i></p>Kevyn Aucoin&#39;s faces appeared in editorial features, fashion shows, music videos, and advertising campaigns as well as on the covers of virtually every major magazine.

After his second year in college, over summer break, Ueshiba took his first step into the realm of professional comics by writing the script for what would become his hit debut work <i>Discommunication</i>. He would then submit the work to Kodansha's Chiba Tetsuya Contest for New Artists&#x3001;And to his surprise the short would go on to pick up the General Award for their 1991 edition granting him the option to be signed up to work on a series for the publisher. <br><br>His latest work <i>Mysterious Girlfriend X</i> was adapted into an animated TV series distibuted in the US by Sentai Films.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;This first manga series installment is a fantastical foray into teenage sexuality with a dose of feminist superhero antics. Tsubaki is a typical teen boy: a sophomore in high school, he still hasn't had his first kiss. He obsesses about what his future girlfriend might be like and is immediately infatuated with Urabe, the mysterious new girl in school. Everyone notices something peculiar about Urabe: she laughs uncontrollably at inopportune times and can never stay awake in class. Tsubaki finds her asleep after class one day and wakes her so that she doesn't miss her bus home. After she leaves, he notices a puddle of drool on her desk. Overcome with curiosity, he decides to taste it. Then things really start to get weird. Urabe's drool holds a mysterious power that Tsubaki gradually becomes aware of over the course of the series. What happens next is part normal teenage romance, part mysterious surrealism. The series also touches on topics such as feminine power and consent, which makes it an excellent read for individuals of all ages but especially teens who are navigating their entry into the dating world. The artwork is beautifully executed in traditional manga style, complementing the plot. VERDICT A fun read with complex story lines, realistic character development, and surreal elements that will appeal to teen and adult manga fans alike.&#x2014;Marian Mays, Washington Talking Book &amp; Braille Library</p><h2>Am I small?
